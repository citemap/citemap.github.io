Solo <a href="../../glossary.html#sex" title="Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs." class="lexicon-term">sex</a>. ‘Bating. Ménage à moi. Jacking off, jilling off, whacking off. Paddling the pink canoe, pocket pinball, teasing the kitty, testing the plumbing, fingerbating, jerkin’ the gherkin, spanking the monkey, soaking the whisker biscuit, surfing the channel. No matter what you call it—or how goofy what you call it is—masturbation is one of the few things that almost everyone does, has done or will do. About as many people masturbate as people who play video games, and there are <i>more</i> people who masturbate than people who have computers at home or who own cars. In surveys and studies, as many as 95 percent of all people report that they masturbate or have done so.<b> </b></p>
<p>Most of us, if not all, masturbated before we can even remember: infants and very young children commonly touch their own <a href="../../glossary.html#genitals" title="External sexual or reproductive organs." class="lexicon-term">genitals</a> and other body parts, and from what we can tell, do so seeking comfort and pleasure. That early stimulus and that early kind of sexuality is very different then adolescent or adult sexuality, but while motives and execution may differ, it’s <a href="../../glossary.html#masturbation" title="Ways that people seek out and/or experience sexual pleasure by themselves, without a sexual partner." class="lexicon-term">masturbation</a> all the same. Masturbation is, most plainly put, doing things to sexually stimulate yourself, and most often by engaging with your own genitals in some way.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with masturbation, and it’s even clearly good for you in some ways. Most doctors and medical organizations, counselors, sex therapists, and sex educators agree: for our sense of well-being, relaxation, and health; our sexuality with or without partners, developing a means for <a href="../../glossary.html#sexual" title="About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality." class="lexicon-term">sexual</a> <a href="../../glossary.html#communication" title="Various ways we express and share feelings or thoughts, such as through speech, written words or symbols, sign language, body language, touch or art." class="lexicon-term">communication</a>, getting familiar with our own sexual response cycle and preferences, and finding out where all our parts are, how they work and some of what we like and how we like it, masturbation is the bomb.</p>
<h3>Masturbation will not:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cause blindness, headaches, or vision problems</li>
<li>Cause hair to grow on your palms <em>(but wouldn't that be a cool trick?)</em> or give you zits</li>
<li>Make your genitals shrink or grow, or change their <a href="../../glossary.html#sensitivity" title="A responsiveness to internal or external stimulus." class="lexicon-term">sensitivity</a>, color, texture, or appearance (beyond temporary changes often brought on by sexual <a href="../../glossary.html#arousal" title="A state of sexual excitement and interest that sends messages to the brain which create physical changes and sensations, such as increased blood pressure, erection, lubrication, loosening of the vaginal or anal muscles, and increased physical sensitivity." class="lexicon-term">arousal</a> and/or sensation like <a href="../../glossary.html#erection" title="When a body part, such as the penis or parts of the vulva, becomes filled with blood and enlarges and/or becomes more firm." class="lexicon-term">erection</a>, deeper color and heightened sensitivity)</li>
<li>Stunt your general growth or the development of your sexual organs, or make you more or less fertile</li>
<li>Become addictive (some people are or become sexually compulsive, and that can include masturbation, but that's not the same thing as addiction)</li>
<li>Cause injury or harm (when done safely—obviously, sticking a <a href="../../glossary.html#penis" title="One of the two external reproductive organs of people assigned male at birth." class="lexicon-term">penis</a> in a vacuum hose, or using an electric <a href="../../glossary.html#vibrator" title="A sex toy that, true to its name, provides stimulation by vibrating. They come in every imaginable shape, size, and color, and can be operated by regular batteries, electrical cords, or rechargeable batteries (like a cell phone.) " class="lexicon-term">vibrator</a> in a bathtub isn’t real swift and would likely cause injury)</li>
<li>Change the size or shape of your genitals</li>
<li>Release “stored up” <a href="../../glossary.html#sperm" title="Reproductive cells of people with penises which can fertilize an ovum and create pregnancy." class="lexicon-term">sperm</a> or sexual fluids.

<h3>Masturbation can:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Help relieve <a href="../../glossary.html#menstrual" title="Having to do with menstruation." class="lexicon-term">menstrual</a> cramps and muscle tension</li>
<li>Be a source of physical and emotional relaxation</li>
<li>Increase circulation</li>
<li>Increase the ability or ease to be orgasmic (and is almost always the way people first learn to experience <a href="../../glossary.html#orgasm" title="An event typically in response to physical or intellectual sexual stimulation, controlled by the involuntary nervous system.

<li>Be self-care</li>

</ul>
<h3>How Do You Masturbate?</h3>
<p>How any one person masturbates is based on their mood, and on their individual psychological, emotional, and physiological makeup and life history. All these variables affect what arouses people, brings about orgasm, and sexually satisfies them. So, while for one person, rubbing their penis or <a href="../../glossary.html#clitoris" title="A sexual organ both external and internal on the vulva and inside the pelvis of those assigned female at birth that is similar to the penis, but serves no other known purpose besides providing sexual pleasure." class="lexicon-term">clitoris</a> briskly with their hands or fingers with little lead-up may get them off, another may like to read a book while using a sex toy, and another still may enjoy a long soak in the tub followed by a slow and gentle self-massage. What a given person likes also can differ from day to day, month to month and year to year. Ways of masturbating that "work" for someone for a while sometimes stop feeling so amazing or resulting in orgasm: when that happens, you usually just need to mix it up a little or try some new things.</p>
<p>Masturbation is not always just about genitals. Plenty of people also incorporate touching or stimulating other parts of their bodies: breasts, nipples or chests, thighs, hands or feet, parts of their faces—you name it, somebody’s touched it while masturbating. Some people experiment with certain sexual practices alone, rather than with (or before sharing with) partners, by using new sex toys or certain types of role-play or <a href="../../glossary.html#sexual_fantasy" title="An idea, thought or pattern of thoughts and/or ideas that creates or enhances sexual feelings." class="lexicon-term">sexual fantasy</a>.</p>
<p>For many people, it’s common to combine activities like the above, rather than just doing one thing, or stimulating one particular area. You may also find it takes a while to find what really works for you, or that something that was satisfying once isn’t so satisfying anymore, and want to mix it up a bit.</p>
<p>What’s a good way to get started with masturbation? Find a space where you feel safe and comfortable, and where you don’t have to worry about being walked in on or interrupted. While some people do approach masturbation in a perfunctory way (and that’s okay), the truth is that it’s like any sort of sex: it’s usually far more compelling and enjoyable when you’re aroused and going all-in. So, while you certainly can masturbate any time you'd like, it usually feels a lot more intense and more satisfying for people when they're turned on before they start and/or while they're doing it and when they're totally focused on the sexual experience.</p>
<p>Many people fantasize before or during masturbation. Most people have fantasies about what they’d like to do alone or with someone else sexually, and that’s as fine a place to start as any. Another route to fantasy can be memories of previous sexual experiences. If that's not you, if you don’t tend to feel or experience sexual <a href="../../glossary.html#desire" title="A feeling of strongly wanting something. In the context of sex, desire can be a strong feeling of a physical and psychological want for any kind of sex.
" class="lexicon-term">desire</a> about others or about yourself, or are not in the mood for that kind of fantasy, by all means, start with whatever elicits your own sexual curiosity or desire. <a href="../politics_sexuality_etc/making_sense_of_sexual_media.html"> Some people use sexual or other kinds of media to provide fantasy fodder for masturbation.</a></p>
<p>While, no, you can’t really kiss yourself, you <em>can</em> massage your lips with your fingers, for instance, or run your hands over the sensitive areas of your neck, nipples, legs, or arms. Remember, your whole body is full of nerve endings and sensory receptors: the genitals aren’t the only sexual or sensitive spaces you’ve got, not by a long shot. Take your time: When you’re masturbating, you are your own lover, so treat yourself, and your body, just the way you’d like a lover to treat you. You don't need to make it a quickie unless you want to.</p>
<p>When and if you do want to move the action to your genitals, keep in mind that this is all about you—what feels good to you, what you want—not about what you’ve seen or heard works for someone else, or about what you think you should do for sex with partners later. So, while a lot of people might enjoy stroking the penis with their hands, others might find that rubbing their groin up against something feels good at a given time. Some people want to incorporate vaginal stimulation into their masturbation, others like to keep things limited to their external clitoris or other parts of the <a href="../../glossary.html#vulva" title="The name for the external genitals of people assigned female at birth. The vulva includes the mons, external clitoris, inner and outer labia, fourchette and perineum." class="lexicon-term">vulva</a>. Because you don’t have to negotiate with anyone about anything you do when you masturbate, what you do is 100 percent your call and entirely and only about what <i>you</i> want and enjoy.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Here are some common ways people masturbate with their genitals:</h3>
<p><strong>People may and do stimulate the penis, scrotum, <a href="../../glossary.html#perineum" title="The general region of the body between the anus and the testes or the anus and the vaginal opening.  Some people call the perineum the &quot;tain&#039;t.&quot;" class="lexicon-term">perineum</a>, and/or <a href="../../glossary.html#anus" title="The external opening to the rectum, located between the buttocks.
" class="lexicon-term">anus</a>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With hands and fingers (usually with a <a href="../../glossary.html#lubricant" title="A fluid used in order to make kinds of sex (such as masturbation, vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse or manual sex) more pleasant and comfortable, and/or to help prevent condoms from breaking by decreasing friction.
" class="lexicon-term">lubricant</a> or lotion), such as by stroking, rubbing, or slapping the <a href="../../glossary.html#shaft" title="On the penis, the portion of the penis extending from below the head to the base of the penis, where it is attached to the body. On the vulva, an internal portion of the clitoris behind and beneath the clitoral glans." class="lexicon-term">shaft</a> and base of the penis</li>
<li>By using something to surround the penis, such as a sex toy made for that purpose, or household objects like fruit skins, socks, or warm towels, or with suction, such as with a penis pump</li>
<li>With vibration or pulsation to the penis, scrotum, anus, or general genital area, either via vibrators or small vibrating objects, by sitting or leaning on larger vibrating items, or with water</li>
<li>With vibration, massage, or <a href="../../glossary.html#entry" title="In a sexual context, when a kind of sex involves someone putting one body part inside the body part of another person, such as with intercourse.  Some people use the word &quot;penetration&quot; instead." class="lexicon-term">entry</a> of the anus with hands or objects</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>People may and do may stimulate the entire vulva, or some portions, including the clitoris, inner or outer <a href="../../glossary.html#labia" title="On the vulva, both inner (labia minora) and outer (labia majora) sets of skin with sensory nerve endings which surround the vaginal opening." class="lexicon-term">labia</a>, the <a href="../../glossary.html#vaginal_opening" title="The external opening to the vagina." class="lexicon-term">vaginal opening</a> or canal and/or the perineum or anus:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With fingers, rubbing, pinching, massaging, or tapping the external genitals (such as the clitoris or labia) and/or inside the internal genitals, such as the <a href="../../glossary.html#vagina" title="The internal passage leading from the opening of the vulva to the cervix of the uterus." class="lexicon-term">vagina</a> or <a href="../../glossary.html#rectum" title="The internal passage between the anus and the colon; stores solid waste until it leaves the body through a bowel movement.
" class="lexicon-term">rectum</a></li>
<li>With general stimulus to the whole genital area, such as by squeezing thighs together rhythmically, by “humping” a pillow, or by sitting or leaning on a vibrating object, such as a washing machine</li>
<li>With objects or items for vibration, such as by applying a water source (like a shower or water jet), vibrator, or massager to the clitoris or vulva as a whole</li>
<li>With objects for vaginal or anal entry (and usually with lubricant), such as dildos or other safe and similar objects</li>

<h3>Keeping It Safe</h3>
<p>While masturbation is legit the safest sex there is, there are still a couple safety issues to bear in mind.</p>
<p>Genital tissue is pretty delicate. So, anything that might cut, scrape, or burn you, or anything that might cause electrocution or create very harsh suction is something you should avoid to prevent injury. A good rule of thumb is that if it looks like it might hurt you, it probably will, and if anything starts to hurt when you do it, instead of feeling good, stop. Pain is usually the bodies way of telling us to change something up or stop doing something altogether.</p>
<p>Bacteria are a concern with masturbation. Washing your hands before you masturbate is always a good idea; our hands pick up loads of germs during a normal day, and these can cause genital infections. In regard to toys or objects used during masturbation, if they can’t be boiled to sanitize them, it’s always best to cover them up with a <a href="../../glossary.html#condom" title="A thin sheath or tube of latex or another material, worn over the penis during sex to prevent or reduce the risk of pregnancy and/or sexually transmitted infections.
" class="lexicon-term">condom</a> or other latex barrier to avoid bacterial infections.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Oh, hey.</h3>
<p>Even though people usually masturbate seeking pleasure, it isn't always that pleasurable or even interesting sometimes.</p>
<p>That can be for a lot of reasons.</p>
<p>When you're new to it, or when a way of masturbating has gotten old and you need to find new ways of doing it that work for you, it can take a while, sometimes weeks, months or even longer, to really find out what you like and how to make things that feel good happen. If you're doing it like it's a chore you have to do, or the way you play a video game you play all the time, instead of putting the kinds of things around it people often do with sex they enjoy with partners -- like only doing it when you're excited about it, doing things besides just genital touching, really getting into your own sexyness, doing it in a space that feels right -- that often makes it less enjoyable and satisfying. If you're trying to do what you think <em>should </em>feel good, instead of experimenting a lot to find out what you yourself actually like, that can keep you from finding your own grooves. Try and keep a balance of copying what you have seen or heard about with just trying things that come from your own head or what your body is responding to. If you're having trouble actually doing the things that feel good to masturbate -- like trouble reaching something, or difficulty because of disability -- that can obviously create problems! You may need to get creative with adaptations. And if you feel shame or guilt around it, it can also really impact how it feels. You may need to go through some emotional processing about it. We're always happy to try and help with any of these kinds of situations or more in <a href="../../need_help_now_a_guide_to_scarleteens_direct_services.html">our direct services</a>, including referring you out to outside information or resources, if you want.</p>
<p>If it turns out that it isn't something you like, feel into, or want to do -- whether that's the case for a week or the case for years -- you certainly don't have to do it.  You can also have a satisfying sex life you like without masturbation. And if you're in a time where it feels like a drag, or like something that makes you feel less good about your body or sexuality, or feels like pressure, you probably want to step away for a bit. Don't let the idea that it can help with sex with partners get you hung up on this idea that you have to do it, or else you won't be able to have sex with someone else (nope), or sex with others will also nec essarily suck (also nope). It's supposed to be for <em>you </em>and about what provides you pleasure, comfort or both. If it's not bringing those things to you, don't sweat it.  You can find and do other things that provide you pleasure and comfort instead.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Are masturbation and sex with a partner the same?</h3>
<p>Masturbation all by yourself and any kind of sex with someone else aren’t interchangeable. They’re <em>interrelated</em> sometimes, but necessarily different, and one can’t usually substitute for the other (partnered sex <i>especially</i> can’t take the place of masturbation, because you have to consider and pay attention to the other person as much as you do yourself).</p>
<p>That’s why a lot of people who have current sex partners, with whom they’re even highly satisfied, still enjoy masturbation; it often fills different wants and needs altogether. (And it is absolutely fine to masturbate when you have a partner—if your partner has a problem with that, have a talk about it. Plenty of people even masturbate together as a part of partnered sex.) Often, masturbation can easily fulfill the physical needs and desires we have for sexual gratification.</p>
<p>Obviously, partnered sex also carries a whole bunch of risks, consequences, and complexities that solo sex doesn’t. But most of all, emotionally and intellectually, masturbation and partnered sex are pretty different. When masturbation just isn’t cutting the proverbial mustard, that’s likely either because we just haven’t found what works physically yet, or, more likely, because we’re craving more companionship and intimacy than just physical stimulation and our own company. When sexual partnership doesn’t feel right, but we want to be sexual, it’s likely because the privacy, safety, and self-centeredness (in the good way) of masturbation is more up our alley at a given time.</p>
<h3>How much is too much?</h3>
<p>It’s common, when you masturbating is or feels new to you, to perhaps want to spend a lot of time doing it, just like when you find a band you really love, and want to listen to their latest song over and over in an endless, hypnotic loop. For some, it might start to feel a little compulsive or out of control—like if you find yourself masturbating in places that aren’t all that private, or find that your masturbation habits are starting to interrupt or intrude upon other parts of your life.</p>
<p>Generally, it’s a pretty simple formula: <em>Is masturbation keeping you from doing other things you enjoy, like being with friends or partners, participating in sports, hobbies, goals, or interests? Is it interfering with your responsibilities (schoolwork, family duties, chores, or a job)? Is it infringing upon your health (keeping you up nights, keeping you from eating properly), causing any sort of injury (such as sore, swollen, raw, blistered, or chafed skin), or creating emotional conflict or distress for you? </em>If it’s doing any of those things, then it’s probably time to cut back or ask for help (a mental <a href="../../glossary.html#healthcare_provider" title="A qualified person to provide sound physical and/or mental healthcare, such as a doctor, nurse, clinician, counselor, medical assistant, midwife or other healthcare professional." class="lexicon-term">healthcare provider</a> can help, or you can just talk to anyone you trust and respect with something sensitive and loaded like this). If it’s not, and it feels good to you, don’t sweat it. There's no "right" amount of masturbation just like there's no "right" amount of sex with partners: it's all about what just feels and is right for <strong>you</strong>.</p>
<h3>Be Your Own First</h3>
<p>We hear a whole lot about who should or shouldn't be our first sex partner. We’re often told it should be someone we love and who loves us back, someone committed to us long-term, perhaps even someone we plan to spend the rest of our lives with.</p>
<p>And I think it should be, and that person is YOU. You, all by yourself, have all of those qualities and abilities, more than any other person.</p>
<p>Claiming and recognizing yourself as your first and foremost sex partner -- be it literal, symbolic, or both -- is powerful. Your sexuality <em>is</em> yours, is totally about <em>you</em>, and it mostly comes from <i>you</i>, not from anything or anyone outside you. No one else is ever going to be able to get to know and understand your body well unless you do. Being your own partner equips you with tools that support a healthy sexuality and balanced sexual relationships for the rest of your life: the ability to determine when it’s the right time for you to have solo sex and when it’s right to take a partner. Getting to know your own body and sexual <a href="../../glossary.html#identity" title="The defining character or personality of an individual; who we feel like we are as a person. Identity is often used to talk about sexual identity -- who we are as sexual people, which can include things like our sexual orientation, our preferences and things we like and want in sex and sexuality, our sexual politics -- or gender identity, who we feel we are and identify as (even if only to ourselves) in terms of our gender." class="lexicon-term">identity</a> through self-evaluation, through masturbation, enables you to find out a great deal of what you like and dislike sexually and physically, to see and feel what your genitals and the rest of your body are like in a healthy state, to discover how your individual sexual response works, to explore your orientation and <a href="../../glossary.html#gender_identity" title="A person&#039;s own sense of whether and in what sense they feel they might be a man, a woman, neither, a mixture of genders, or another gender entirely." class="lexicon-term">gender identity</a>, to explore your fantasies, and to gauge your sexual expectations realistically. It’s something that supports your sexuality and sexual life feeling like it’s really yours.</p>
<p>That isn’t to say that if you haven’t started regularly masturbating before sexual partnership began for you that it’s too late, because it isn’t. It doesn’t mean that if masturbation doesn’t interest you, you’re immature or that you’ll necessarily have lousy partnered sex or that this is otherwise required. It's not. Rather, the point is simply that masturbation is a great way for a lot of people to explore their sexual selves in a very safe, open setting. It’s not called self-love for nothing, you know.</p>
