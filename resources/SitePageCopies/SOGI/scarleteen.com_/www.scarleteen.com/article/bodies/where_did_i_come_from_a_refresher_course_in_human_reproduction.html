Medically, someone is considered to be pregnant when an egg has been fertilized by sperm, cells divide, and the fertilized egg is implanted within the lining of the uterus." class="lexicon-term">pregnancy</a> happens seems simple, know that it's not. It's not a big mystery at this point, and it's something we can understand, but it's way more complex than two different kinds of cells happening to be in the same place at the same time and -- <strong>VOILA!</strong> -- baby. How to get to a pregnancy is actually a pretty complicated map, and one with many obstacles.</p>
<p>Chances are good that if you are in your teens, twenties or even beyond them, you've only had it explained in the most simple, and probably incomplete or incorrect, ways. Just like with anything complicated, the more anyone simplifies it, the less accurate our understanding can be. There are giant textbooks just about the process of human reproduction, so even an article like this one, where we go into depth and detail, is still a simplification. But our aim is that even in paring the process down some, you'll walk away understanding how pregnancy happens -- and how it doesn't -- a lot better than you do now.</p>
<p>Some of our users voice concepts of reproduction that are incomplete, exaggerated or straight-up fantasy. Ideas like <a href="../../glossary.html#sperm" title="Reproductive cells of people with penises which can fertilize an ovum and create pregnancy." class="lexicon-term">sperm</a> that leap from place to place like fleas (were that true, I would so have a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9BjN_GHIic">sperm circus</a> in my office), a teaspoon of <a href="../../glossary.html#semen" title="Fluid which comes from the urethra of the penis during ejaculation, and which usually contains sperm. Sperm cells are only about 2-5% of what&#039;s in semen: semen also contains amino acids, enzymes, flavins, fructose, prostaglandins, proteins, acids and other elements. In human reproduction, semen both helps sperm &quot;swim,&quot; and counteract the acidic nature of the vagina, which would otherwise be hostile to sperm." class="lexicon-term">semen</a> that possesses the magic ability to soak through more layers of fabric than a glass of water, or methods of <a href="../../glossary.html#contraception" title="Devices, medications or behaviors used to intentionally aim to prevent pregnancy, including the condom, the cervical barrier, the implant, the patch, the pill, the rhythm method, the ring, the shot, the IUD, spermicide and withdrawal.
" class="lexicon-term">contraception</a> we know are practically foolproof when used properly being utterly useless aren't even remotely based in facts, but in fear, fantasy or just truly poor understandings of how this all really works. We've experienced people terrified about becoming pregnant when they have not been part of anything that can cause a pregnancy; others who are taking big pregnancy risks without any awareness of them. If you're worried or freaking out about pregnancy often, especially when you're not even doing the things that can pose real risks of pregnancy, or you are doing those things, but are doing so using more than one method -- or even just one -- of highly effective contraception consistently and correctly, here's hoping this explanation and some visuals of what really happens -- and what really can't -- can help you to chill out.</p>
<h3>The Birds and The Bees, for Real (in which there are neither birds nor bees)</h3>
<p>What you've probably heard about most when it comes to how pregnancy happens are gametes: a kind of cell that can fuse with another kind of gamete to potentially create a pregnancy in organisms, like people, that reproduce that way. (Curious about some cool ways other organisms can reproduce? <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/498542/reproduction/76147/Reproduction-of-organisms">Check this out</a>.) Sperm cells are one kind of gamete; <a href="../../glossary.html#ovum" title="A reproductive cell, sometimes also called an egg. Ova (plural) are stored in the ovaries and released into the fallopian tubes during ovulation, and can then be fertilized by sperm cells which can result in pregnancy." class="lexicon-term">ovum</a> (egg) cells are another. When those two kinds of cells are able to come into contact with each other is when a pregnancy can potentially result. If that sounds awfully simple, that's because it is. Too simple. There's a whole lot more than that which needs to happen to create a pregnancy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="../../sites/files/scarleteen/Map-to-the-Ovum.gif" style="margin: 5px; width: 640px; height: 497px;" /></p>
<p>A lot of people have been told about reproduction with the emphasis on sperm cells, which might be some of why some folks have imagined them as playing a way bigger part, all by themselves, than they do. So, I want to flip the script here and start, instead, with ova, or egg cells.</p>
<p>In most people of reproductive age (in or past <a href="../../glossary.html#puberty" title="The process of physical and sexual changes from childhood to adulthood, initiated by hormone signals from the brain to the gonads. Puberty usually takes several years to complete -- sometimes even more then five or six -- and changes the brain, bones, muscles, skin, breasts and reproductive organs. " class="lexicon-term">puberty</a>, but before menopause) who have a <a href="../../glossary.html#vagina" title="The internal passage leading from the opening of the vulva to the cervix of the uterus." class="lexicon-term">vagina</a> and a <a href="../../glossary.html#uterus" title="In people assigned female at birth (unless it has been surgically removed or was not formed in utero), an internal, muscular reproductive organ in the pelvis. During pregnancy, this is where a fetus will develop. When not pregnant, it is the lining of the uterus, when shed each cycle, that provides a menstrual period." class="lexicon-term">uterus</a>, their <a href="../../glossary.html#ovaries" title="The reproductive organs that contain and release ovum." class="lexicon-term">ovaries</a> -- tiny sacs just outside the ends of the <a href="../../glossary.html#fallopian_tubes" title="Two tubes that lead from the ovaries to the uterus.  If and when an ovum is fertilized by a sperm, fertilization typically happens within the fallopian tube." class="lexicon-term">fallopian tubes</a> -- contain ovarian follicles, which are immature ovum. In people the age of our typical readers, usually millions of them.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../sites/files/scarleteen/Eggless-Pass.gif" style="margin: 5px; float: left; width: 250px; height: 202px;" />During each <a href="on_the_rag_a_guide_to_menstruation.html">fertility or menstrual cycle</a>, one of those usually develops, is released by the ovaries and pulled into one of the fallopian tubes. The link at the start of this paragraph, paired with <a href="get_with_the_flow_all_about_fam.html">this one</a>, can tell you more about the fertility cycle, and about what has to happen for that ovum to develop and get released in the first place. If there's no ovum, or won't be one within a few days, pregnancy can't happen.</p>
<p>When an egg does get released, that cell starts slowly moving through the fallopian tube (and it is always slowly and gradually moving: it's not just sitting around waiting for sperm cells to call and ask it out). When there's an ovum in the fallopian tube, or one is soon to head that way, a couple other things are also usually going on. For one, cervical mucus, the fluid around the <a href="../../glossary.html#cervix" title="The opening to the uterus, the bottom of which is at the back end of the vagina." class="lexicon-term">cervix</a>, tends to become very watery and stretchy. The os, the opening of the cervix, gets softer and more open. For sperm cells to even have a chance of getting to the egg, both of these other things have to be happening. And both of these things, as well as the available ovum, are a limited time offer: all of this usually only happens for a few days in each cycle.</p>
<p><img alt="Clothes on? Pregnancy can't happen." src="../../sites/files/scarleteen/b69e67f9-db49-4bbd-a805-3492d5ef9756.gif" style="margin: 5px; float: right; width: 250px; height: 201px;" />While all of this is happening, should someone with a <a href="../../glossary.html#penis" title="One of the two external reproductive organs of people assigned male at birth." class="lexicon-term">penis</a> ejaculate ("come") inside the <a href="../../glossary.html#vaginal_opening" title="The external opening to the vagina." class="lexicon-term">vaginal opening</a>, or very directly unto the <a href="../../glossary.html#vulva" title="The name for the external genitals of people assigned female at birth. The vulva includes the mons, external clitoris, inner and outer labia, fourchette and perineum." class="lexicon-term">vulva</a> -- things that can't happen when people are dressed, or aren't likely to with indirect transfer, like with semen from penis to hand to vulva -- then we've got some of the other things needed for a potential pregnancy: semen and sperm cells.</p>
<p>Semen and sperm are not the same thing. Semen (seminal fluid or plasma) is a fluid from the seminal vesicles, the <a href="../../glossary.html#prostate_gland" title="A highly sensory, walnut-sized gland inside the body, below the bladder and between the rectum and urethra at the base of the penis." class="lexicon-term">prostate gland</a>, cowper's gland, and the bulbourethral glands, which all comes through the <a href="../../glossary.html#urethra" title="The urinary tract, where people pee from. On a penis, the opening to the urethra is at the head of the penis; on a vulva, the opening is above the vaginal opening and below the external clitoris." class="lexicon-term">urethra</a> and out of the opening of the penis during <a href="../../glossary.html#ejaculation" title="In a sexual context, a discharge of genital fluid, usually (but not always) as a result of sexual stimulation and/or orgasm." class="lexicon-term">ejaculation</a>. Ejaculation most typically happens right around or nanoseconds after <a href="../../glossary.html#orgasm" title="An event typically in response to physical or intellectual sexual stimulation, controlled by the involuntary nervous system. Orgasm often results in muscle contractions in and around the genitals, other muscular spasms throughout the body, and a feeling of sexual and/or tension release." class="lexicon-term">orgasm</a>, but not always: sometimes people ejaculate without any orgasm.</p>
<p>Semen almost always contains sperm cells but it is not, itself, just made up of just those cells. Less than 5% of semen is sperm cells. The rest is a whole bunch of things, all essential for sperm to do anything: proteins, enzymes, acids, and a good deal of fructose (a sugar), a needed energy source for sperm cells. The fluid of semen is how sperm cells can move out of the penis, and through the vagina. Just like a fish can't swim out of water, same goes for sperm without the fluid they're ejaculated with. But it does more than that. It supplies nutrients and energy those cells need to be able to do anything at all, and it also neutralizes things that create problems for sperm like traces of urine and the vaginal environment. The push an ejaculation gives that fluid also matters.</p>
<p>A person with testicles ("balls") usually produces millions of sperm every day. They're microscopically small: we can't see them without a powerful microscope. When ejaculation occurs -- and this is something a person with a penis knows has happened, not something they can't know or have to guess at -- there's usually around a teaspoon or so of that semen, which can contain hundreds of millions of sperm. Sperm cells are very fragile and super-duper sensitive. They are not resilient to things like being moved around from place to place -- like from penis to hand, then hand to vulva -- to changes in temperature, or to environments besides the <a href="../../glossary.html#testes" title="Reproductive glands of people with penises. They sit outside the body and are contained within the scrotum." class="lexicon-term">testes</a> and special lab conditions designed to protect them.</p>
<p>So, let's say we have an available ovum, and all the other conditions on that person's body to make pregnancy even possible, and someone with a penis has also ejaculated inside the vagina or very nearby (and by nearby, I mean on the <a href="../../glossary.html#genitals" title="External sexual or reproductive organs." class="lexicon-term">genitals</a>, not on someone's thighs, chest or a few feet away). For the next step to happen after that, sperm cells need to get through the vaginal canal, and then into the cervix. But they often can't do one or both of those things.</p>
<p>During some parts of the fertility cycle, for a person with a vagina and uterus, cervical mucus is too thick and pasty for those cells to be motile (to move), and the opening to the cervix isn't open enough for them to get inside of it. Sometimes, sperm cells have to wait within the vagina or other parts of the reproductive system because they got there too soon: an egg, and the other conditions needed, weren't there for them yet. Sperm cells can potentially stay within the vaginal environment for a few days: <em>they</em> can be the ones waiting for the phone to ring, as it were. Other times, there's just not enough semen or viable sperm cells in that semen for these next steps. In a lot of ways the vagina, cervix and uterus aren't friendly to sperm cells: that system even "attacks" some sperm cells to try and counteract them similar to the way our bodies try to counteract unhealthy bacteria or other potentially harmful visitors.</p>
<p>Even in perfect conditions, less than a thousand sperm cells -- of those initial millions! -- will make it to the fallopian tubes, and only a few dozen of the sperm cells may wind up reaching the outer membrane of the egg cell, if any do. That's one reason the body produces so many of them.</p>
<p>When they can get through the vagina, and through the cervical opening, what sperm cells remain will go both ways they possibly can, some to one fallopian tube, some to the other. Once in the fallopian tubes, sperm cells are helped by contractions of the uterus to keep moving, and also by the cilia, super-tiny organelles (<span class="st">a specialized subunit within a cell) </span>in the fallopian tube that push the sperm cells towards the egg cell; but others get kind of tangled up and stuck in the cilia instead. Chemicals inside the reproductive system also help out, changing the sperm cells to give them more energy.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../sites/files/scarleteen/Implantation.gif" style="margin: 5px; float: left; width: 300px; height: 335px;" />Those that went to the tube with a live egg surround it -- at this point, there are usually less than just fifty or so of them left -- and try to enter the sac. If the ovum is healthy, sperm will push into the protective layers around it, and into sperm receptors that are part of the membrane around the egg cell. Then it's just a matter of which one of the few remaining sperm cells is able to then get to the egg first and fertilize it, with the egg also taking part by pulling the sperm cell inside. When the egg does that, and secretes some special enzymes, that locks out any of the other sperm cells left trying to get in.</p>
<p><strong>And that's when we've got what's called fertilization of the egg. But we still don't have a pregnancy yet.</strong></p>
<p>If and when the process continues, about a day or so after fertilization the egg cell and the sperm cell together become something new, a <a href="../../glossary.html#zygote" title="The initial cell formed when a sperm has fertilized an ovum, which then travels down the fallopian tube for a few days, dividing into a larger cluster of cells to become a blastocyst." class="lexicon-term">zygote</a>. It starts to divide into many cells, staying in the fallopian tubes keeping busy with that for a few more days. That zygote then starts moving towards the uterus, dividing more all the while. It changes some more, becoming a hollow ball of cells called a <a href="../../glossary.html#blastocyst" title="A stage of very early fetal development. If cell development continues and a blastocyst implants in the uterus, it will become an embryo and create a pregnancy." class="lexicon-term">blastocyst</a>, and that is what may -- or may not -- implant in the uterine wall, attaching into the <a href="../../glossary.html#endometrium" title="The lining of the uterus." class="lexicon-term">endometrium</a> (the uterine lining, the same lining that shed during a <a href="../../glossary.html#period" title="The fluid, which contains blood, from the shedding of the uterine lining usually at the end of each fertility cycle. Or, that flow you perhaps may have experienced once while shouting, &quot;Oh thank GAWD!&quot;" class="lexicon-term">period</a>) and then become an <a href="../../glossary.html#embryo" title="During a pregnancy, the term for the developing cells of an organism until around eight-nine weeks after an ovum was fertilized. After this time, the organism would then be called a fetus." class="lexicon-term">embryo</a>. Conception or implantation are the terms used most often for this stage of the process.</p>
<p>Many times, without any interference from anyone, fertilized eggs don't divide or implant and a pregnancy does not occur: it's understood right now that as many as 50% of implantations do not complete (and this isn't something anyone is ever likely to notice or know happened to them, since when that happens, menstrual periods will tend to happen as usual, and a person doesn't feel anything with just a fertilization).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../sites/files/scarleteen/Egg-Gone-Rogue.gif" style="margin: 5px; float: right; width: 250px; height: 196px;" /></p>
<h4><strong>But if and when all of that up there <em>does</em> happen, and that blastocyst <em>does</em> implant itself in the uterus? <em>That's</em> when we've got ourselves a pregnancy.</strong></h4>
<p>All in all, the process from the moment ejaculate enters the vagina to implantation, what is medically recognized as a pregnancy, <a href="http://contraception.about.com/od/howyoubecomepregnant/g/Implantation.htm"> tends to take anywhere between around five days to two weeks</a>. This is one of the reasons <a href="../../glossary.html#emergency_contraception" title="A method of contraception used to prevent pregnancy after sex or rape has already occurred, rather than used before or during, like most types of contraception." class="lexicon-term">emergency contraception</a> can work even though it's taken after <a href="../../glossary.html#intercourse" title="When people interlock their genitals and move together as feels good to them for the purpose of sexual stimulation and/or reproduction." class="lexicon-term">intercourse</a>, and also why, if you're freaking about feeling all these pregnancy symptoms just a couple days after a possible risk, you can know that whatever you're feeling is <em>not</em> from a pregnancy, because pregnancy doesn't happen that fast.</p>
<p>From implantation on, some people will choose to continue a pregnancy, others will choose to terminate it with an <a href="../../glossary.html#abortion" title="A procedure to intentionally end a pregnancy before a birth. Miscarriage is also sometimes called &quot;spontaneous abortion,&quot; even though it is usually not intended." class="lexicon-term">abortion</a> procedure. A pregnancy may also end on its own any time before delivery (birth) due to <a href="../../glossary.html#miscarriage" title="When a pregnancy ends before birth all by itself, often without anyone having done anything to make that happen." class="lexicon-term">miscarriage</a> or other complications. Should a person choose to continue a pregnancy, and should it run its full course, all of this is just the beginning of an equally complex and evolving process of around forty weeks of pregnancy and fetal development until delivery, or birth, which is its own complex process. Phew!</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../sites/files/scarleteen/Spermice-Lair.gif" style="margin: 5px; float: left; width: 250px; height: 202px;" /><strong>On what days can someone get pregnant?</strong> On potentially any day there is direct vaginal contact with sperm, and most typically, <a href="../../glossary.html#vaginal_intercourse" title="When a penis or sex toy is inserted into and held by the vagina while partners move their bodies as feels good to them for the purpose of either sexual stimulation and/or reproduction." class="lexicon-term">vaginal intercourse</a>. There are <a href="get_with_the_flow_all_about_fam.html">times in a fertility cycle</a> when a person is MOST likely to become pregnant, and times when a person is least likely and even not at all likely to become pregnant. But someone with the capacity to become pregnant can technically become pregnant any time they have the kind of contact with a penis or ejaculate that can create a pregnancy. Fertility cycles differ a lot from person to person, so there is no one safe, or safer, or one fertile, nor infertile, time for everyone. However, as we'll address in a sec, using reliable methods of contraception correctly and consistently makes pregnancy unlikely on any day they are used.</p>
<p><strong>I've heard the chance of becoming pregnant is the same as the chances of winning the lottery. Is that true?</strong> A person with a uterus, engaging in or experiencing the kinds of <a href="../../glossary.html#sex" title="Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs." class="lexicon-term">sex</a> or contact that present a risk of pregnancy, who does not use any form of <a href="../../glossary.html#birth_control" title="Any number of methods people use to intentionally prevent unwanted pregnancy, including the condom, the cervical barrier, the implant, the patch, the pill, the rhythm method, the ring, the shot, the IUD, spermicide and withdrawal.
" class="lexicon-term">birth control</a> has an 80 - 90% chance of becoming pregnant within one year. The higher end of that are those between their late teens and early twenties; both fertility rates and <a href="../../glossary.html#sexual" title="About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality." class="lexicon-term">sexual</a> activity rates -- and not using contraception consistently or properly -- tend to be highest in that age group. The majority of unintended pregnancies also tend to occur within the first six months of a person engaging in sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>The unintended pregnancy rate among teens who are <a href="../../glossary.html#sexually_active" title="Someone who has had or is currently having some kind of genital sex with a partner or partners." class="lexicon-term">sexually active</a> is more than twice the national figure for all sexually active people of reproductive age. The rate among sexually active 18–19-year-olds (162 per 1,000) is more than double the national figure. There are substantially greater numbers of unintended pregnancies still among women aged 20–24 than among younger women. <em>("Unintended Pregnancy Among U.S. Adolescents: Accounting for Sexual Activity," Lawrence B. Finer, the Guttmacher Institute)</em></p>
<p>That's a far better chance than anyone has of winning the lottery. When people say things like that, what they're usually trying to express is that even when all the right conditions for a pregnancy are there -- there was intercourse or other direct contact, active sperm cells, and an available egg -- a pregnancy still isn't guaranteed, and still is a considerable gamble, like we've explained in this piece. Two couples can both have vaginal intercourse, with all the same timing and all the right conditions, but sometimes both will become pregnant, sometimes only one will and sometimes neither of them will.</p>
<p><strong>Can you get pregnant if your <a href="../../glossary.html#hymen" title="A thin membrane without nerve endings that most people with vaginas are born with that is just inside the vaginal opening. It gradually wears away over time due to hormones, vaginal discharges, general physical activity, sex and masturbation and/or childbirth. It does not snap, crackle or pop." class="lexicon-term">hymen</a> isn't broken?</strong> The hymen has nothing to do with reproduction or pregnancy. (It also doesn't usually "break" in the first place, which you can find out all about <a href="my_corona_the_anatomy_formerly_known_as_the_hymen_the_myths_that_surround_it.html">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Typically, well before someone ever has intercourse it has already started wearing away, as it will gradually through a lifetime. Even when it is mostly intact, there are still microperforations (small openings) of most hymens which do not present a barrier to semen or sperm cells. Without those small openings, menstrual flow and other vaginal fluids would be unable to leave the body.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../sites/files/scarleteen/Inhospitable-waters.gif" style="margin: 5px; float: left; width: 250px; height: 198px;" /><strong>Can I get pregnant if my <a href="../../glossary.html#partner" title="In a sexual context, a person with whom someone is having some kind of sex. The term &quot;partner&quot; can be used for all kinds of relationships, not just serious ones. &quot;Partner&quot; can also mean the person someone is with in a romantic or familial partnership." class="lexicon-term">partner</a> ejaculates in his pants/in the bathtub/across an interstate highway (and so forth)?</strong> The way people become pregnant, setting aside in-vitro technologies, is through direct vulval or vaginal contact with semen that is being ejaculated right there and then. Sperm cells can only stay motile up to around a half hour or so in an environment that is unfriendly to them (in other words, outside the testicles, vagina or in specific lab conditions). Again, they are very, very delicate, especially once outside the testes. Were there a comic book about sperm, they wouldn't be the superheroes: they would be the helpless folks superheroes need to save. I don't mean to go all cagematch, but if egg cells and sperm cells were to have a fight, sperm cells wouldn't stand a chance.</p>
<p>So while, for instance, having unprotected <a href="../../glossary.html#anal_sex" title="Sexual activity involving the anus.  Anal sex may include stimulation with fingers, the mouth, a penis, sex toys, or other objects or body parts.
" class="lexicon-term">anal sex</a> where sperm can run right down into the vagina does create a possible (but unlikely) risk of pregnancy, it isn't anything close to as likely a risk as it is with vaginal intercourse. If there is a distinct barrier, like clothing or a <a href="../../glossary.html#condom" title="A thin sheath or tube of latex or another material, worn over the penis during sex to prevent or reduce the risk of pregnancy and/or sexually transmitted infections.
" class="lexicon-term">condom</a>, or serious distance between the vagina and the penis in question, such as pants, a condom, a body of water or a mall, there is not a likely risk of pregnancy. People also do not have to worry about pregnancies being caused by things like semen left on bedding, toilets or sinks, shaking hands with someone who maybe masturbated that day, or any other kind of indirect contact like that. In addition, you cannot get pregnant by swallowing semen, through <a href="../../glossary.html#oral_sex" title="Use of the mouth, lips or tongue for sexual stimulation. Cunnilingus (&quot;going down on&quot;), fellatio (&quot;blowjobs&quot;) and analingus (&quot;rimming&quot;) are some common kinds of oral sex." class="lexicon-term">oral sex</a>, or by manual ("handjobs" or "fingering") sex. For a list of these and other sexual activities that do not pose any risks of pregnancy, <a href="../../birth_control_bingo_no_pregnancy_risks.html">click here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How can I tell if I'm pregnant?</strong> By taking a home <a href="../../glossary.html#pregnancy_test" title="What we tell you to take when you ask us if you&#039;re pregnant. A test that can be done at home or by a healthcare provider to determine pregnancy. Usually a urine test, a pregnancy test measures for a specific hormone, hCG, only produced with pregnancy. " class="lexicon-term">pregnancy test</a>, according to the directions, or by seeing a <a href="../../glossary.html#healthcare_provider" title="A qualified person to provide sound physical and/or mental healthcare, such as a doctor, nurse, clinician, counselor, medical assistant, midwife or other healthcare professional." class="lexicon-term">healthcare provider</a> who can examine and test for a pregnancy.</p>
<p><div class="pullquote"><hr /><div class="quotecontent">When people have strong fears or shame about sex or pregnancy, it's easy to let facts fly out the window, and feel like what fear "says" can change the facts: it can't. In the event this explanation or others like it, don't seem to make a dent in your fears, it may be that what you actually need is to figure out what those feelings are really about, and make some different choices with that awareness, or be evaluated for anxiety disorders, like OCD, which can create these kinds of persistent, irrational fears or make them feel unmanageable.</div><hr /></div>Even though there are so many things going on during any part of the process of a pregnancy becoming one, none of these are things people feel, or which create any noticeable change in anyone's body: no one can physically feel them going on. That's why the vast majority of people don't know they even might be pregnant until they miss a period. The changes in the body, or changes to how a person who is pregnant feels, don't tend to start showing up until at least a few weeks after <a href="../../glossary.html#conception" title="The onset of pregnancy, marked by implantation of the blastocyst into the endometrium (the lining of the uterus)." class="lexicon-term">conception</a>, and sometimes longer than that. Most of the things users come to us thinking are symptoms of pregnancy a few days or weeks after a risk (or not-a-risk, but they're freaking anyway) are either not real symptoms in the first place -- like feeling "fluttering" in the stomach, a feeling that is usually gas, including for people who are actually pregnant -- or are things that don't tend to happen until many weeks or months into a pregnancy, like weight gain, changes to the size of the abdomen, or enlarged breasts.</p>
<p>And when there <em>are</em> symptoms early in pregnancy they're nearly impossible to distinguish from <a href="../../glossary.html#PMS" title="Short for &quot;premenstrual syndrome&quot;. A varying set of symptoms that many people who menstruate experience just prior to their period. Possible symptoms may include irritability, fatigue, cramps, headaches, backaches, nausea, moodswings, feeling bloated, breast tenderness, and a huge number of other physical and emotional symptoms." class="lexicon-term">PMS</a> or other things that can cause similar symptoms. A missed period is usually the very first symptom most pregnant people experience or notice, but since periods can go late or missing for many other reasons, and not everyone has regular periods to know when they're late, a test or an exam from a healthcare provider is really the only way to go.</p>
<p>There's just no sound way to know early in a pregnancy besides a test. You can use a home pregnancy test either after a late or missed period (and a late period is generally defined as a period that hasn't shown up when it's been about five days later than the latest you'd expect it), or a few weeks after a risk: the instructions on a test will tell you when to take it to best assure your results are accurate. If a test shows a positive, a person should then go to a healthcare provider's office to have them confirm the pregnancy. If someone feels they know what choice they likely want to make with a pregnancy, they can elect to have that confirmed at a visit to a a midwife, <a href="../../glossary.html#OBGYN" title="A physician who specializes in obstetrics and gynecology; in the reproductive and sexual health of people with a vulva, including providing care with pregnancy, contraception, sexually transmitted infections and menstrual, vulval or vaginal issues and concerns." class="lexicon-term">OB/GYN</a> or an abortion provider.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../sites/files/scarleteen/Diaphragm-Boulder.gif" style="margin: 5px; float: right; width: 250px; height: 198px;" /><strong>How can I have NO risk of pregnancy? How can I have no risk but still have intercourse?</strong> Not engaging in sexual intercourse or other direct genital-to-genital contact is the most effective way to prevent pregnancy, and is the only way for there to be no risk: to have absolutely no risk, ever, a person needs to avoid the kinds of contact that present that risk. So, you can't have intercourse and have no risk at all.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../sites/files/scarleteen/Latex-Levee.gif" style="margin: 5px; float: left; width: 250px; height: 221px;" />But people can still have intercourse and other similar contact with only a very, very small risk of pregnancy: so small that many people can have intercourse for many years, even a lifetime, and have it never result in pregnancy. To do that, reliable methods of contraception -- <a href="../sexual_health/birth_control_bingo.html">birth control methods</a>, like condoms, <a href="../../glossary.html#the_pill" title="A common term for birth control pills/oral contraceptives. A hormonal medication used to prevent unwanted pregnancy." class="lexicon-term">the pill</a> or ring, an <a href="../../glossary.html#IUD" title="Intra-uterine device. A long-term birth control method inserted into the uterus by a healthcare provider. Also called an IUS or IUC." class="lexicon-term">IUD</a> or <a href="../../glossary.html#cervical_barrier" title="A birth control device which is inserted into the vagina to cover the cervix and prevent sperm from entering. Diaphragms, cervical caps and contraceptive sponges are kinds of cervical barriers." class="lexicon-term">cervical barrier</a> -- need to be used correctly and consistently.</p>
<p>When they are always used, and used as directed, reliable methods of contraception, <a href="../sexual_health/birth_control_bingo.html">like those listed here</a>, do a great job of preventing pregnancy. Dual contraception -- using two methods, not one, like pairing condoms with the pill, as an example -- does that even better. As you <a href="../sexual_health/the_buddy_system_effectiveness_rates_for_backing_up_your_birth_control_with_a_.1371.delaye">can see here</a>, any two methods used together perfectly, even the least effective of them, are all at least 99% effective at preventing pregnancy in one year of use, and any two used together even just typically, which includes some mistakes now and then, are still over 92% effective at a minimum. When people have intercourse and become pregnant unintendedly it is most often because no method of contraception was used, or one was, but not properly.</p>
<h3>Want to find out more about pregnancy?</h3>
<p>Many people wind up getting information about pregnancy in all the wrong places: either from one person's anecdotes (which often include their own misunderstandings and chosen narratives), supremely unreliable places on the 'net -- including some who intentionally omit information or give misinformation because they have a personal agenda about people's choices once pregnant -- movies or television, and we're not talking about on the Discovery Channel.</p>
