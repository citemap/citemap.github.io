Sure, you may know where the <a href="../../glossary.html#penis" title="One of the two external reproductive organs of people assigned male at birth." class="lexicon-term">penis</a> is... but what about the rest of it? This simple guide walks you through the external and internal reproductive and urinary anatomy for most penis-bearing folks.</p>
<h3>Consider The Penis</h3>
<p>Whether you give it a name or not, the ol&#39; one-eyed wonderworm seems like a pretty simple critter from the outside, but it&#39;s actually a bit more complicated than many people think.</p>
<p>On the outside, there are five major things you can see: the <a href="../../glossary.html#glans" title="On the penis, the head of the penis. On the vulva, the external portion of the clitoris, beneath the clitoral hood." class="lexicon-term">glans</a> or head, the <a href="../../glossary.html#corona" title="A newer name for the hymen, a thin membrane without nerve endings that most people with vaginas are born with that is just inside the vaginal opening. It gradually wears away over time due to hormones, vaginal discharges, general physical activity, sex and masturbation and/or childbirth. It does not snap, crackle or pop." class="lexicon-term">corona</a>, the frenum, the urethral meatus, and the <a href="../../glossary.html#shaft" title="On the penis, the portion of the penis extending from below the head to the base of the penis, where it is attached to the body. On the vulva, an internal portion of the clitoris behind and beneath the clitoral glans." class="lexicon-term">shaft</a>. For those who are uncircumcised, there is a sixth, the prepuce or <a href="../../glossary.html#foreskin" title="A loose tube of skin with nerve endings that extends from shaft of the penis to below the glans and which normally covers the head of the penis when it is not erect. Those born with penises are also born with a foreskin, but some foreskins are removed (circumcised) in infancy or later in life for any of a variety of different reasons." class="lexicon-term">foreskin</a>.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s take it from the top.</p>
<p>At the tip of the penis you will find the urethral meatus, the opening of the <a href="../../glossary.html#urethra" title="The urinary tract, where people pee from. On a penis, the opening to the urethra is at the head of the penis; on a vulva, the opening is above the vaginal opening and below the external clitoris." class="lexicon-term">urethra</a>, where urine comes out when you urinate. It&#39;s also where pre-ejaculatory fluid and <a href="../../glossary.html#semen" title="Fluid which comes from the urethra of the penis during ejaculation, and which usually contains sperm. Sperm cells are only about 2-5% of what&#039;s in semen: semen also contains amino acids, enzymes, flavins, fructose, prostaglandins, proteins, acids and other elements. In human reproduction, semen both helps sperm &quot;swim,&quot; and counteract the acidic nature of the vagina, which would otherwise be hostile to sperm." class="lexicon-term">semen</a> come out of the penis. The urethra inside the penis has both a urinary function and a reproductive one. This is not the case for people who have a <a href="../../glossary.html#vulva" title="The name for the external genitals of people assigned female at birth. The vulva includes the mons, external clitoris, inner and outer labia, fourchette and perineum." class="lexicon-term">vulva</a>: urethras and vaginas are entirely separate orifices.</p>
<p><img class="img_assist img-responsive" align="none" src="../../sites/files/scarleteen/styles/large/public/images/maleinternaled4f.jpg?itok=dgYDP8aZ" width="480" height="370" alt="male internal anatomy" /></p>
<p>The urethral meatus is usually located in the center of the head or glans of the penis, the mushroom or helmet-shaped, somewhat bulbous, section that composes the end of the penis.</p>
<p>The little ridge that runs all the way around the bottom of the head of the penis is called the corona, and just below the spot on the underside of the penis where the corona makes a little V shape is the frenum (sometimes called the frenulum). For some, the tiny little patch of skin that is the frenum is the most intensely sensitive part of the whole penis, but that&#39;s not always the case. For many, the glans is also very sensitive, and for those who are uncircumcised, the foreskin as well is sensitive, being very rich with nerve endings, as are the areas beneath stimulated by the foreskin.</p>
<p>The shaft of the penis is exactly that - the shaft, the part that makes up the part of your penis that isn&#39;t the glans. When the penis is hard, it is common to see veins just under the skin. The veins can look kind of bulgy and weird sometimes, but as long as they are not painful in any way, that&#39;s perfectly normal.</p>
<p><img class="img_assist img-responsive" align="left" src="../../sites/files/scarleteen/styles/large/public/images/circuncirc646e.jpg?itok=rUVgmC9_" width="192" height="480" alt="circ/uncirc" />If you are NOT circumcised, you will have what&#39;s called a prepuce or foreskin. This is a loose tube of skin, chock full of nerve endings, that grows out from the shaft of the penis just below the glans and which normally covers the head of the penis when it is not erect - one guy I know says his always makes him think of a little sleeping bag for the penis. All people born with penises are also born with foreskins, but some (the majority, in North America, but a great minority elsewhere in the world) foreskins are surgically removed when a baby is a few hours or days old in a process called <a href="../../glossary.html#circumcision" title="A surgical removal of the foreskin from the penis, most often done in infancy, and most often done because of cultural or religious beliefs, parental aesthetic preferences or concerns about health.  In some cases, circumcision is done at other times of life and/or for medical reasons." class="lexicon-term">circumcision</a>. It is normal to have a foreskin, and it is also common to not have one. However, in 1999, the American Pediatric Association finally made clear that there is no medical basis for infant circumcision.</p>
<p>If you do have a foreskin, the foreskin can be pulled back, away from the head of the penis, and this should be pretty easy to do. If it&#39;s difficult to do, or painful, or impossible, talk to a doctor. You need to pull back (also called retracting) the foreskin in order to put on a <a href="../../glossary.html#condom" title="A thin sheath or tube of latex or another material, worn over the penis during sex to prevent or reduce the risk of pregnancy and/or sexually transmitted infections.
" class="lexicon-term">condom</a> correctly. Also, if you cannot retract the foreskin adequately, <a href="../../glossary.html#sexual" title="About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality." class="lexicon-term">sexual</a> activities (including <a href="../../glossary.html#masturbation" title="Ways that people seek out and/or experience sexual pleasure by themselves, without a sexual partner." class="lexicon-term">masturbation</a>) can be painful.</p>
<p>The skin of the penis can sometimes be several shades darker than the skin of the rest of your body, either all the time or just when the penis is hard. That&#39;s totally normal. It&#39;s also normal to have the penis change color somewhat when it gets hard. It is common for penises to turn red, brown-red, or even purple! The coloration should return to normal once the <a href="../../glossary.html#erection" title="When a body part, such as the penis or parts of the vulva, becomes filled with blood and enlarges and/or becomes more firm." class="lexicon-term">erection</a> goes down.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also common to have some <a href="../../glossary.html#pubic_hair" title="The hair that grows around the genital and anal regions (often extending a ways up the front or back and onto the inner thights) and usually first appears around puberty. It may vary in color, texture, length, and thickness." class="lexicon-term">pubic hair</a> growing on the shaft of the penis. And of course, anywhere you have hair follicles and sweat glands, it is possible to get a pimple or zit. If you have a sore or blemish on your penis and it looks like a pimple, chances are good that it might be just that, particularly if it is on the bottom third of your penis, where there is most likely to be some pubic hair. If it doesn&#39;t go away in a few days&#39; time, though, or doesn&#39;t seem like a pimple, see a doctor. Any sore that looks like a wart, a cold sore, a sunburn, or a rash on the penis needs to be looked at by a doctor, immediately.</p>
<h3>Life On The Inside: What&#39;s Inside Your Penis</h3>
<p>Now that you know your way around the outside of the penis, let&#39;s look inward. You might already know that the penis gets erect because of blood, but might not know where that blood goes. It doesn&#39;t just fill up the penis like a water balloon! When blood flows into the penis to create an erection, it goes into and fills up two spongy bodies of tissue that run the length of the penis. The corpus cavernosum runs along the top of the penis, and another similar body called the corpus spongiosum runs along the urethra. Both the corpus cavernosum and the corpus spongiosum extend a little way into the body, which is what gives the leverage so that, when these spongy structures are filled with blood, they get stiff and the penis becomes both hard and erect.</p>
<p>Many people associate getting an erection - also known as a hard-on, boner, woody, or by various other names - with being ready for <a href="../../glossary.html#sex" title="Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs." class="lexicon-term">sex</a> or ready to feel sexual pleasure. Truth is, erections can and often do happen quite a few times every day for no particular reason, and certainly not because anything sexual is going on. It just happens. If you&#39;re not interested in any kind of sex at the moment, including masturbation, you can just ignore it, and it&#39;ll go away. Also, your penis doesn&#39;t have to be hard in order for you to feel sexual pleasure. There are many kinds of sensations that can feel sexually good. An erection is not a prerequisite.</p>
<p>The urethra is the long tube that runs the length of your penis and connects to several organs inside your body. Everything that comes out of your penis travels through the urethra - urine, pre-ejaculatory fluid (precum), and semen. The urethra is a very sensitive and delicate duct, and can easily get scarred or infected if you treat it roughly. Sometimes people are curious about how it would feel to put objects up their urethras. This is a bad idea: it can cause serious medical trouble and can even end up requiring surgery on the penis. If you treat the urethra as a one-way street, you should be fine.</p>
<p>Urethra troubleshooting: if your urethra ever burns or itches, particularly when you are peeing, or if you see greenish, yellowish, foamy, bloody, or foul-smelling <a href="../../glossary.html#discharge" title="In the context of sex and sexual health, any number of fluids which come from the genitals. Plenty of genital discharge is healthy, while some discharges can be symptoms of illness." class="lexicon-term">discharge</a> from your urethra, see a doctor immediately. All these things are signs of infections or injuries that need to be treated by a doctor.</p>
<h3>How Big Is It Supposed To Be?</h3>
<p>All right, since I know you&#39;re all dying to know this, here we go: average penis size is somewhere in the vicinity of 5-6 inches long when erect. This average is based on several international different surveys done by researchers and doctors. What this means is that five to six inches is the most common penis length, but that there are penises that are longer and penises that are shorter that are all perfectly normal, healthy, desirable penises.</p>
<p>Penis size has nothing to do with body size. Bigger, taller people do not necessarily have bigger or longer penises. Shorter people don&#39;t necessarily have smaller ones. The size of your hands, feet, or nose is no indicator. Neither is how big a penis is when it is soft: some penises get a lot bigger when they get hard, other penises don&#39;t get all that much bigger when they get hard. Fat people do not have smaller penises than thin people, Asian people do not have smaller penises than White people, and Black people&#39;s penises don&#39;t average any larger than anyone else&#39;s. Those are all stereotypes, and have no basis in truth. Penises come in a lot of different possible sizes. That&#39;s nothing more or less than run of the mill human variation.</p>
<p>The growth of your penis during <a href="../../glossary.html#puberty" title="The process of physical and sexual changes from childhood to adulthood, initiated by hormone signals from the brain to the gonads. Puberty usually takes several years to complete -- sometimes even more then five or six -- and changes the brain, bones, muscles, skin, breasts and reproductive organs. " class="lexicon-term">puberty</a> is hard to predict. There is no magic age when puberty starts and stops, and therefore there is no magic age when your penis will start to grow or stop growing. Sometimes they seem to grow all at once, and a change will seem very sudden, and other times, the change will happen slowly. Again, that&#39;s just normal human variation. Lots of folks worry that their penis won&#39;t be big enough, and that sexual partners won&#39;t like it or won&#39;t want them as partners because of their penis size. That&#39;s really pretty unrealistic.</p>
<p>The penis size issue is a lot like the <a href="../../glossary.html#breast" title="Glandular tissue, fat, connective tissue and skin on the chest. " class="lexicon-term">breast</a> size issue. Breasts, like penises, come in all different shapes and sizes. Some people are attracted to big breasts. Some people are attracted to smaller breasts. Some people like them to be in between. Some people couldn&#39;t care less. Some people don&#39;t even like breasts at all. Most people find that there is a wide range of breast sizes that can be attractive to them, providing that there are other things about the person they&#39;re attached to that are attractive and interesting. Any person who decided to date someone solely because of their breast size would be pretty superficial - and really, it&#39;s pretty insulting to date or <a href="../../glossary.html#desire" title="A feeling of strongly wanting something. In the context of sex, desire can be a strong feeling of a physical and psychological want for any kind of sex.
" class="lexicon-term">desire</a> someone just because of a single body part. We&#39;re people, not parts.</p>
<p>Same goes for penises. Some people prefer longer penises. Other people prefer shorter ones. Many people like average-sized ones. Some people could honestly not care less whether there&#39;s a penis involved in their sex lives or not. And yes, some people don&#39;t like penises at all. Most people find that there are other, more important considerations than penis size when they are considering whom they like as a potential lover, spouse or <a href="../../glossary.html#partner" title="In a sexual context, a person with whom someone is having some kind of sex. The term &quot;partner&quot; can be used for all kinds of relationships, not just serious ones. &quot;Partner&quot; can also mean the person someone is with in a romantic or familial partnership." class="lexicon-term">partner</a>. (Just for the record, this is all also true for <a href="../../glossary.html#gay" title="In the context of sexuality, a word for sexual orientation which either describes a man who is sexually and emotionally attracted to other men, or a person of any sex or gender who is sexually and emotionally attracted to people of the same or a similar sex or gender. Often used alongside lesbian.
" class="lexicon-term">gay</a> and <a href="../../glossary.html#bisexual" title="A term for sexual orientation which either describes a person who can be sexually and emotionally attracted to people of more than one gender." class="lexicon-term">bisexual</a> people, too, not just for <a href="../../glossary.html#heterosexual" title="Someone who is only or mostly emotionally and sexually attracted to people of a different sex or gender than they are themselves." class="lexicon-term">heterosexual</a> people.)</p>
<p>The short answer is that there are a lot of things that are just as or more important than penis size. If you are an interesting, attentive, creative, and responsive person and people enjoy being around you and spending time with you, how big your penis is really won&#39;t matter one bit. Honest, it really won&#39;t. The qualities that make someone desirable, sexy, or a good lover are the qualities I just listed - not the size or shape of any given body part(s). Big feet don&#39;t make you an Olympic runner, big hands don&#39;t make you a concert pianist, and a big penis doesn&#39;t make you a sexual superstar. Talent, attention, smarts, and a desire to do your personal best are what make all those things happen.</p>
<h3>The Family Jewels</h3>
<p>Your scrotum is the little bag of skin lined with muscle that hangs below your penis and contains your <a href="../../glossary.html#testes" title="Reproductive glands of people with penises. They sit outside the body and are contained within the scrotum." class="lexicon-term">testes</a> or testicles. The halves of the scrotum are divided by a wall of muscle. Externally you can see a line, called the raphe, that divides down the center of the scrotum. The scrotum&#39;s muscles are used to pull the testes closer to the body in order to protect or warm them; when the muscles relax, the testes hang considerably lower and the scrotum may look longer. This is why, when you are cold - say you jump into a cold swimming pool or lake - your scrotum shrivels up so that your testicles are held tightly against your body. Your body is trying to keep your testicles warm! The testes or testicles are the most famous and most visible of the many reproductive glands. The testes are about the size of a large olive, and about the same shape. They&#39;re incredibly sensitive to touch and pressure, as any person with testicles who&#39;s ever had a groin injury, even a minor one, can tell you.</p>
<p>The testes produce <a href="../../glossary.html#testosterone" title="A steroid hormone in people&#039;s bodies which is often blamed for a whole lot of things it isn&#039;t actually responsible for." class="lexicon-term">testosterone</a>, the so-called &quot;male&quot; hormone, and they also produce <a href="../../glossary.html#sperm" title="Reproductive cells of people with penises which can fertilize an ovum and create pregnancy." class="lexicon-term">sperm</a>, which are formed in the testes and move into the epididymis to mature. People without penises or testicles have testosterone in their bodies, too, produced mostly by the adrenal glands, an additional source of testosterone in folks with testicles.</p>
<p>The epididymis is a small organ that sits on top of the testicle. It is made up of a little bundle of squiggly tubes and is a &quot;holding pen&quot; for sperm. When you ejaculate, sperm are moved from the epididymis into the vas deferens, the tubes that take sperm up and out of the scrotum area and into other ducts so they can be ejaculated as a part of semen. Sperm that don&#39;t get ejaculated live in the epididymis for around four to six weeks before they die and are reabsorbed into the body. It&#39;s very similar to the way old blood cells die and are reabsorbed and recycled. This is why it&#39;s impossible - even if you never ejaculated in your whole life - to have &quot;excess&quot; sperm build up in your body.</p>
<p>The epididymis and testicle are the two major organs inside the scrotum. They don&#39;t just float around in there, though. They are anchored to the body by what is called the spermatic cord. The spermatic cord is a bundle of nerves and blood vessels that serve the testicle and epidydimis, plus the vas deferens, which is a long tube which carries sperm up and out of the scrotum so that it can be ejaculated.</p>

Well, I&#39;ll tell you: it goes up into the body, where it empties into the seminal vesicles. This is the place where sperm get mixed up with some of the other ingredients that make semen. Sperm themselves are only about two to five percent of the volume of the semen that is ejaculated: the rest is other fluids. Those fluids are produced by several different glands: the prostate, the bulbourethral or Cowper&#39;s glands, and some fluids produced by the vas deferens and the seminal vesicles themselves, and are added to the semen mixture at various points along the way before the semen is ejaculated.</p>
<p>The bulbourethral glands, also called the Cowper&#39;s glands, primarily produce a liquid sort of mucus. It is this fluid that sometimes comes out when someone is really aroused, but before <a href="../../glossary.html#ejaculation" title="In a sexual context, a discharge of genital fluid, usually (but not always) as a result of sexual stimulation and/or orgasm." class="lexicon-term">ejaculation</a>. &quot;Pre-ejaculate&quot; or &quot;precum&quot; is a slippery, sometimes slightly sticky fluid that has the ability to neutralize any acid (from urine) that might be inside the urethra. Since sperm do not thrive under acid conditions, <a href="../../glossary.html#pre-ejaculate" title="A fluid which the penis usually emits with or around erection and before ejaculation, sometimes more than once. Pre-ejaculate itself does not contain sperm, but in some cases, can pick up traces of sperm left in the urethra." class="lexicon-term">pre-ejaculate</a> helps to make the conditions in the urethra favorable for sperm to survive. The same fluid is also a component of semen itself. Because pre-ejaculate has to travel through some ducts that may or may not have sperm lurking in them, it is usually considered fairly likely that there will be live sperm in pre-ejaculatory fluid, though at lower concentrations than in semen. Pre-ejaculate can also carry disease organisms, including the <a href="../../glossary.html#HIV" title="Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a virus that eventually destroys the immune system and weakens the body&#039;s ability to fight disease and infection. It usually progresses to AIDS. It is a serious sexually transmitted infection that requires medical treatment, although it cannot be cured." class="lexicon-term">HIV</a> virus.</p>
<p>The <strong><a href="../advice/meet_your_prostate.html">prostate gland</a></strong> is a large, chestnut-shaped gland that surrounds a small part of the urethra within the body, below the bladder. It marks the spot where the seminal vesicles empty into the urethra, and is also the point at which fluids from the prostate (approximately 30% of the total volume of semen) get mixed into the semen. The prostate is very sensitive to pressure and touch. Many people enjoy having their prostates stimulated, which is usually done by inserting a lubricated and latex-glove covered finger into the <a href="../../glossary.html#anus" title="The external opening to the rectum, located between the buttocks.
" class="lexicon-term">anus</a> - since the prostate is inside the body, this is the only way to reach it, though testicular or <a href="../../glossary.html#perineum" title="The general region of the body between the anus and the testes or the anus and the vaginal opening.  Some people call the perineum the &quot;tain&#039;t.&quot;" class="lexicon-term">perineum</a> massage may more indirectly stimulate the prostate.</p>
<p>After prostate fluid has been added, the semen is now all ready to be ejaculated. It is ejaculated out of the urethra through a series of muscular contractions that begin in the vas deferens and continue all along the path that the sperm and fluid take in order to leave the body.</p>
<p><strong>Urination Information</strong> The urinary system is not nearly so complicated as the reproductive system. Basically, urinary anatomy consists of three basic parts: the bladder, the urethral sphincter, and the urethra itself.</p>
<p>The bladder is the muscular pouch or reservoir that holds urine between the time it is filtered out by the kidneys and the time that you expel it from your body by urinating (peeing). It is quite flexible and can expand to hold quite a bit of liquid, though the amount varies from person to person.</p>
<p>The bladder opens out into the urethra through a sort of muscular &quot;gate&quot; called the urinary sphincter. This is a ring of muscle around the opening between the bladder and the urethra that we learn to voluntarily close or open depending on when we want to urinate. When we open it, urine flows out of the bladder. If it is closed, the urine stays in the bladder. The urethra is a long tube that extends from the bladder all the way to the tip of the penis. It is approximately 8 inches long, though it is sometimes shorter or longer. Urethras within the penis are quite a lot longer than the urethras of those with a vulva: the latter are more often only approximately 4 inches long. The urethra ends at the urethral meatus, the opening of the urethra that is at the tip of the penis, in approximately the center of the head or glans.</p>
