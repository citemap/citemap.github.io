<p>It's really best to be talking with a potential or current <a href="../../glossary.html#sexual_partner" title="Someone besides yourself you have intentionally, actively and physically explored your sexual feelings with in some way, like via sexual activity such as intercourse, oral sex or manual sex." class="lexicon-term">sexual partner</a> about the things you both want and plan to do sexually, rather than have them be "surprises" or "presents." Who knows what he really feels ready for, after all -- and his readiness matters just as much as yours -- and you two will also need to work things out like pregnancy prevention and reducing risks of STIs, as well as managing the emotional aspects of this. As well, it sounds like you're trying to move awfully fast for where you're really at. If you feel scared to even look at your own <a href="../../glossary.html#genitals" title="External sexual or reproductive organs." class="lexicon-term">genitals</a>, I'd say it's way, way too early to have someone else not just looking at them, but intimately engaging with them. It sounds like you also probably aren't ready to do things like start sexual healthcare yet, either, which is really important. I feel like what you're saying would be kind of like someone saying they're ready to swim in the deep end of the pool when they can't even look at water without feeling uncomfortable.</p>
<p>So, my best advice is to slow things way down, recognize that wanting to have sex with someone and really being ready for that are very different things,and to take real time to get to know your own body first, by yourself, and get comfortable with it, and to spend more time doing things like talking together about getting sexual together, and not just about the sexy stuff. Rushing in when you're in the spot you are isn't likely to do anything but create sexual experiences you (or your partner) don't enjoy or feel good about. Better to take the time you need so that these experiences are more likely to be and feel awesome.</p>

<p>Sounds like you need to be using a <a href="../../glossary.html#lubricant" title="A fluid used in order to make kinds of sex (such as masturbation, vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse or manual sex) more pleasant and comfortable, and/or to help prevent condoms from breaking by decreasing friction.
" class="lexicon-term">lubricant</a> or more lubricant than you are. If it feels good when he starts, but then raw or burny if he removes his fingers then inserts them again, that's usually a lubrication issue (so long as you know you're clear of any infections: infections, be they an STI like <a href="../../glossary.html#Chlamydia" title="A very common bacterial infection/STI.

Chlamydia requires medical treatment." class="lexicon-term">Chlamydia</a>, or a general infection like a yeast infection, can cause that kind of burning or feeling of rawness, too). Being very aroused doesn't always mean that there's enough lubrication, especially for activities like fingering or intercourse. Plenty of people who are very aroused still want or need lube. So, if you know you're all clear of any illness that could be causing this, I'd try some lube, or more lube, and see if that helps. Additionally, you might try having your partner use latex gloves for <a href="../../glossary.html#manual_sex" title="Sometimes also called digital sex.

<blockquote><p>Ok I've been on the combination birth control and I know it has to be taken at the same time every day but I was wondering is it still as effective as the <a href="../../glossary.html#perfect_use" title="When a birth control method is used correctly and reliably, the whole time, every time, in accordance with the manufacturer&#039;s directions. Many birth control methods will state an effectiveness for &quot;perfect use&quot; vs. &quot;typical use.&quot; " class="lexicon-term">perfect use</a> rate if you're only a few minutes off when you take it?</p></blockquote>
<p>Perfect use rates for methods like <a href="../../glossary.html#the_pill" title="A common term for birth control pills/oral contraceptives. A hormonal medication used to prevent unwanted pregnancy." class="lexicon-term">the pill</a> are gathered via very controlled, clinical studies and trials. In reality, in daily life, very few people, even those who are amazing in how they use their pill, will have the perfect use rate, especially when we're talking about months or years of use, rather than a given day, week or a couple cycles. I personally think it's a lot more sound to look more at the <a href="../../glossary.html#typical_use" title="When a birth control method is not used perfectly, every single time, the entire time. Many birth control methods will state their effectiveness rates with either &quot;typical use&quot; or &quot;perfect use&quot;. " class="lexicon-term">typical use</a> rate, intended to represent how people most often use methods in daily life, and then figure that if you are an excellent user, you're probably in the middle of the typical and perfect use rate, which for the combined pill, would be around 95% effective in one year of use.</p>
<p>If that doesn't feel like enough for you, and you want as close to 100% protection from pregnancy as possible, your best bet is dual contraception: to use two methods, not just one. You can, for instance, also add condoms (always a good idea since the pill offers no protection against sexually transmitted infections), <a href="../../glossary.html#withdrawal" title="A method of birth control which involves the person with the penis &quot;pulling out&quot; of a vagina well before ejaculation and ejaculating away from a partner&#039;s genitals." class="lexicon-term">withdrawal</a> or a <a href="../../glossary.html#spermicide" title="A chemical agent used for birth control which works by immobilizing or &quot;killing&quot; sperm." class="lexicon-term">spermicide</a> to the pill, and them, even when those methods aren't used perfectly, still wind up with close to 100% protection.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi. I'm 24 and married going on three years and have a one year old daughter. I was a virgin for 22yrs and me and my husband wedded as virgins. Is it still suppose to hurt like the first time everytime? I mean there are times, maybe 2 out of 10- where it feels ok or at least doesn't hurt. But most of time it hurts with me lubricated or artifically lubricated. Am I too small? I got married in December and didn't lose my virginity until February due to not being able to penetrate and pains. What do me and my husband need to do for me to really enjoy the action rather than just what we're sharing(which is fine)? I want to feel somewhat what he feel. I feel weird and frustrated that my vagina doesn't work like how my mom says it suppose to work.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sex of any kind, including vaginal intercourse, isn't "supposed to" hurt at all. Not ever. This kind of sex, like others, is supposed to be about exploring and experiencing pleasure, not feeling discomfort or just avoiding pain. Now, sometimes it might hurt or not feel good, whether that's a first time or a 301st, but it's never supposed to like you're thinking, and when it does, it's often about similar things: someone not being relaxed enough, not being aroused enough, not having engaged in sexual activities without vaginal entry they enjoy first before (or also during) intercourse, having a partner who is too hasty or unresponsive, and so forth. You make clear lubrication isn't an issue. There are also health conditions that can cause pain with vaginal entry and other kinds of sex.</p>
<p>So, the first best step is always to check in with a healthcare provider, because if it's about something like an infection or other health issue, there will often be nothing you or your partner can do to change what's going on without getting that taken care of first, and it's also important for your overall health that if you have any conditions that need treatment, you get that treatment. If you either get the all-clear on this not being about a health issue, or it was, but even after treatment it still hurts, then it's likely about one or more of those things I first suggested or other similar issues. In the case that intercourse is most or all of the kinds of sex you and your husband are engaging in and spending time with, that right there is likely at least part of the problem. Your sexual/reproductive healthcare provider is sometimes also someone you can talk to together about this even when it's not about a health issue. They may be able to give you some sex education you might need, or point you to resources to help you learn more about engaging in sex together.</p>
<p>Vaginas don't have static sizes, like small or large. When nothing is inside the vagina, all vaginas are basically closed. When something is inside the vagina, most will expand to whatever size that thing is in the right conditions, with some level of variation accounted for between women (for instance, accounting for women who are pre-menopause or post-menopause, who have or have not recently had a vaginal birth, who may have health conditions which can cause the <a href="../../glossary.html#vaginal_opening" title="The external opening to the vagina." class="lexicon-term">vaginal opening</a> or canal to be less flexible), but far less than most people assume there is. How flexible the vagina is and how comfortable insertion is is mostly situational.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi, I'm 21, a girl, and have quite an embarrassing problem. I "cum" a lot. Not during sexual thoughts, but just at random. I'm assuming it's my hormones but not sure. Today it happened really BAD while I was running! So bad that it went through my underwear onto my jogging pants. This is the first time it's done it this bad. To be honest I don't even do it that much while having sex. How normal/un-normal is this? How can I make it stop? I'm quite worried it'll happen again while I'm not home.</p></blockquote>
<p>This probably isn't <a href="../../glossary.html#ejaculation" title="In a sexual context, a discharge of genital fluid, usually (but not always) as a result of sexual stimulation and/or orgasm." class="lexicon-term">ejaculation</a> or "cum." Female ejaculation is only so common to begin with, and it's not at all likely to be something that occurs without pretty targeted sexual stimulus (in other words, at times you're not only engaging in sex, but engaging in sex that involves quite a lot of attention to your internal and/or external clitoris). Vaginal discharges, however, can happen all the time, any time, and are often totally unrelated to sex or sexual <a href="../../glossary.html#arousal" title="A state of sexual excitement and interest that sends messages to the brain which create physical changes and sensations, such as increased blood pressure, erection, lubrication, loosening of the vaginal or anal muscles, and increased physical sensitivity." class="lexicon-term">arousal</a>. They're part of the fertility cycle, and also part of the way the vagina cleans itself. As well, if this is happening when you're running, it could also just be sweat, or sweat in addition to your other normal discharges.</p>
<p>If you find that you're having a lot more <a href="../../glossary.html#discharge" title="In the context of sex and sexual health, any number of fluids which come from the genitals. Plenty of genital discharge is healthy, while some discharges can be symptoms of illness." class="lexicon-term">discharge</a> than you're used to, or it's smelling or looking funky to you, that can be about genital infections, including things like bacterial or yeast infections which are common, and often develop without any kind of sexual activity. If you think that might be the case, or even just want to make sure, check in with a healthcare provider.</p>

<p>Not directly, unless the kind of sex someone who has periods has results in pregnancy. However, plenty of people experience stress around their sexual lives, and the way we react to stresses can.</p>

<blockquote><p>Am I still a virgin? I've never had sex with anybody before but I've bled when I first started masturbating, and I used a fake <a href="../../glossary.html#dildo" title="An insertive sex toy that usually looks more or less like a penis (but can sometimes bear little resemblance) and is usually made from silicone or rubber, but can also be made with glass, wood, metal, or any number of innovative materials.

I have a boyfriend who will probably be my first and I don't want him to think I'm lying about my virginity.</p></blockquote>
<p>That depends on how you choose to define your virginity. Definitions vary a lot, but it's most common for people to define virginity as having something to do with some kind or kinds of consensual sex with a partner, not <a href="../../glossary.html#masturbation" title="Ways that people seek out and/or experience sexual pleasure by themselves, without a sexual partner." class="lexicon-term">masturbation</a>, though it could be about masturbation if you wanted it to be. It's up to you, just like it's up to you to choose to even use virginity as an idea at all. No one has to.</p>
<p>Too, bleeding isn't proof or disproof of virginity or sexual activity. People can experience vaginal bleeding for a host of reasons, and, when it's related to sex, that can happen -- or not happen -- the first time someone is sexual or the 301st time. If you were masturbating by inserting toys or other objects, chances are you had bleeding because you weren't lubricated enough or aroused enough, which is why bleeding, when it happens, most typically happens with any kind of sexual activity, including masturbation. You might also want to know that most people do not experience bleeding with wanted, consensual first-time sex with partners and again, if and when they do, it's much more often about those things than about their sexual history.</p>
<p>Here's my hope: my hope is that whoever you choose as a sexual partner, be it your first time or way down the road, you're choosing partners who build trust with you and put much more value in who you are and what you say to them than whatever they might perceive about you based on a body part. I think that's pretty ground zero stuff for the kind of partner everyone deserves. So, if you think someone you might choose would be the kind of person who isn't like that? Then my best advice would be not to choose that person as a partner, rather than to worry about bleeding to try and prove something to someone.</p>

<p><b>tanuf_20 asks:</b></p>
<blockquote><p>I am 24 years, I'm engaged and soon going to get married. Problem is that me and my fiancee were together in bed for 1 night and we kissed each other and just touching and pressing each other, then we got aroused and I entered my fingers in her vagina, they easily entered in her. So I had doubt that is she a virgin. When I entered my fingers in her there was also no bleeding.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most of the time, if vaginal entry is difficult or causes bleeding, that's not because of anything to do with a person's sexual history. Rather, it's about someone not being aroused enough (or at all), not wanting what was happening to be happening, not being lubricated enough, or feeling nervous, scared or otherwise tense. In other words, what most likely happened here is that your partner wanted that kind of sex, and felt comfortable with you and excited by you, making that vaginal entry painless and comfortable for her, which I'd assume you'll think is pretty excellent news and what you'd hope for a sexual partner to feel when with you.</p>
<p>As well, like I mentioned above, most people do not bleed with first-time sex, including first-time vaginal entry. People's body parts and reactions -- or lack of them -- can very rarely give anyone sound or useful information about their sexual history. The most accurate way to find out about that is just to ask someone what their history has been. I assume that if you're serious enough about this person to be choosing to get married, then you have a great deal of trust with her, and can take her at her word about what she says her history is. If not, then it seems like the issue here isn't about her body parts, but about trust.</p>
