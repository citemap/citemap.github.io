You're in the excellent company of millions of young people who've used our site and its services every year since 1998 for sexuality, <a href="https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex" title="Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs." class="lexicon-term">sex</a> <span class="print-footnote">[1]</span>, <a href="https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual" title="About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality." class="lexicon-term">sexual</a> <span class="print-footnote">[2]</span> health, <a href="https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#relationship" title=" family relationships, friendships, romantic relationships, and sexual relationships. Sometimes there is an overlap where we have more than one kind of relationship with someone. Sometimes people use the word relationship to only mean a romantic, &quot;serious&quot;, or committed relationship, even though that&#039;s not all this word means." class="lexicon-term">relationship</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span> information, advice and support. Because we've been around so long and been so busy, there are thousands of pages of information here, so sometimes new users feel a little bit lost about how to get started. This page should help make you an expert at navigating the site and all it has to offer in no time.</p>
<p><div class="pullquote"><hr /><div class="quotecontent"><strong>Insert Your Rainbow, Unicorn or Glitter of Choice Here:</strong> Scarleteen is a diverse, inclusive space where we are strongly and actively committed to making and keeping a space that feels as safe as possible for everyone, which honors the diversity of human sexuality and <a href="https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#identity" title="The defining character or personality of an individual; who we feel like we are as a person. Identity is often used to talk about sexual identity -- who we are as sexual people, which can include things like our sexual orientation, our preferences and things we like and want in sex and sexuality, our sexual politics -- or gender identity, who we feel we are and identify as (even if only to ourselves) in terms of our gender." class="lexicon-term">identity</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span>. Scarleteen is a <a href="https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#queer" title="In the context of sexuality, a broad term for sexual orientation that can describe any number of orientations which are not heterosexual. People who identify as queer may be bisexual or pansexual, gay or lesbian, questioning, asexual or more. " class="lexicon-term">queer</a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span>-friendly (we're queer-owned-and-operated, so it'd be pretty odd if we weren't) and inclusive space.

We ask everyone here to work together to co-create and help nurture such an inclusive space, where often very loaded topics are discussed, by following and respecting the <a href="http://www.scarleteen.com/user_guidelines_privacy_policy">user policies and guidelines, </a> <span class="print-footnote">[7]</span>and our users and staff together do a great job of nurturing a community that's safe and friendly for everyone.</div><hr /></div></p>
<h3>Do you need help as soon as possible?</h3>
<p>As you can find on the front page, right in the middle, under the text that reads "Need Help Now?" we have a few ways to get you connected with help pretty darn fast. Links to all three of our fast direct services are also on the top of every page of the site.</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> You can go to our <a href="http://scarleteen.com/bb/index.php?sid=d5b07636f5171c6ce63f31cbb4500c79" title="Message Boards"><strong>message boards</strong></a> <span class="print-footnote">[8]</span>. You need to register to use them, but that only takes a minute and an active email address where you can collect your password and then log in. After you do that, you can post at the boards, and a member of our staff or volunteer squad will usually reply within a few hours or sooner.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> If you are in the United States, and have a cell phone, you can use our <a href="http://www.scarleteen.com/text_scarleteen" title="text/SMS sex ed service"><strong>SMS service</strong></a> <span class="print-footnote">[9]</span>, where you can ask for help from one of our staff or volunteers directly. To do that, just text your questions to: <strong>(206) 866-2279</strong>.  The service is free from us, but message and data rates from your mobile provider may apply.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> You can use our <a href="https://www.scarleteen.com/our_live_chat_service">live chat service</a> <span class="print-footnote">[10]</span>. That link leads you to information about it, including our current typical chat hours. When we're online, you can click into chat and one of our staff or volunteers can talk with you right away.</p>
<h3>Getting Around and Finding What You Need:</h3>
<p>Near the top right of every page, including the front page, you'll see a search window you can use to search for whatever you like. On the front page, you can also check out a few new or featured articles we suggest.</p>
<p>On every page, you'll also find a link just to the right of the logo for a text-only site, should that kind of format be more accessible for you, or in the case you just prefer it.  On the far right, you'll also see a button to donate to the site: Scarleteen is a fully-independent organization funded entirely by independent donors.</p>
<p>Beneath that line is a block we use for announcements.</p>
<p>From the front page, or any other page on the site, you'll see a main navigation box, top and center, which contains the section indexes and links to our direct services.</p>
<h3>Those sections, and their general content, are:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bodies:</strong> Anatomy, body parts, general physical health and <a href="https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#body_image" title="Our sense, awareness and perception of our body in appearance and function as it relates to our sense of self." class="lexicon-term">body image</a> <span class="print-footnote">[11]</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Gender: </strong>Anything specific to gender or which addresses or is about gender.</li>
<li><strong>Sexual Identity: </strong>Parts of sex or sexuality that are, or can be, part of who we feel we are sexually and as a whole person, like orientation, certain relationships models, kink and more.</li>
<li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Relationships and relationship issues.</li>
<li><strong>Sex and Sexuality:</strong> Just what it says -- sex and sexuality basics and not-so-basics.</li>
<li><strong>Sexual Health:</strong> Sexually transmitted infections and diseases, <a href="https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#contraception" title="Devices, medications or behaviors used to intentionally aim to prevent pregnancy, including the condom, the cervical barrier, the implant, the patch, the pill, the rhythm method, the ring, the shot, the IUD, spermicide and withdrawal.
" class="lexicon-term">contraception</a> <span class="print-footnote">[12]</span> (<a href="https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#birth_control" title="Any number of methods people use to intentionally prevent unwanted pregnancy, including the condom, the cervical barrier, the implant, the patch, the pill, the rhythm method, the ring, the shot, the IUD, spermicide and withdrawal.
" class="lexicon-term">birth control</a> <span class="print-footnote">[13]</span>), and other parts of sexual health and sexual healthcare.</li>
<li><strong>Pregnancy and Parenting:</strong> Pregnancy, how it happens, what all your options are if and when it happens, and parenting.</li>
<li><strong>Abuse and Assault:</strong> Sexual <a href="https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#abuse" title="Purposeful harm or mistreatment of another person, which can be verbal, emotional, physical or sexual. An ongoing pattern or cycle of such mistreatment or harm can characterize an abusive relationship.
" class="lexicon-term">abuse</a> <span class="print-footnote">[14]</span>, assault and other kinds of interpersonal violence: how to prevent it, and how to heal when it happens to you.</li>
<li><strong>Sexual Politics:</strong> Political aspects of sexuality, gender, bodies and more.</li>
<li><strong>In Your Own Words: </strong>First-person pieces from our readers -- read or submit one yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Advice:</strong> Answers from our staff, volunteers or guest columnists to user-submitted questions.</li>
<li><strong>Etc:</strong> For things that just didn't seem to fit in any other section.</li>
<li>That navigation menu also contains links to <strong>our message boards, live chat and SMS services</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>If you click on any of those links, you'll be brought to the main page for each of those sections, most of which will have an index of articles.</p>
<p>Some sections have more than one page of articles: if you scroll to the bottom of the page and see a "next" link, you can click on that to be brought to additional pages of articles within that section. As well, all those sections also have a right sidebar of links to advice columns relevant to the subjects of that section, and another below that provide links to other great sites.</p>
<p>At the bottom of every article or advice column is a grey block titled "more like this." Those links are to similar or related content.</p>
<p>At the bottom of every page of the site is a red block that contains important links to other parts of the site,  site and user guidelines and policies, information about us as an organization, our social media channels and, on the left hand side, a short list of tags with a "more" link at the bottom that leads to a list of all our tags.</p>
<h3>Tags</h3>
<p>You'll also notice that at the bottom of every article there is anything from one to several lines, with little stars to the left, in grey boxes: that's a list of sections the piece you're looking at is posted in and words or phrases relevant to that article. Clicking on any of those tags will bring you to other articles and resources related to that subject, word or phrase. So, let's say you want to know more about the <a href="https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#clitoris" title="A sexual organ both external and internal on the vulva and inside the pelvis of those assigned female at birth that is similar to the penis, but serves no other known purpose besides providing sexual pleasure." class="lexicon-term">clitoris</a> <span class="print-footnote">[15]</span>, so you'd click on the tag for clitoris. Then you'll see <a href="https://www.scarleteen.com/tags/clitoris">some other suggested articles and resources</a> <span class="print-footnote">[16]</span>.</p>
<p>Tags are a great way to help you find exactly the information you're looking for quickly, so you don't have to go through the indexes when you know exactly what you want or need and what you're looking for is more specific than general.</p>
<h3>Other Bits:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.scarleteen.com/blog">The Blog</a> <span class="print-footnote">[17]</span>:</strong> Sex education, sexuality, sexual health and young adult issues in the news, presented by Scarleteen staff and volunteers as well as guest writers.</li>
<li><strong>Glossary Words:</strong> In our content, you'll see some words highlighted, and when you roll over them, will see all or part of a defintion.  Those are words or terms that are in our glossary -- which you can also look at in full, if you like, <a href="http://www.scarleteen.com/glossary"><strong>here</strong></a> <span class="print-footnote">[18]</span> -- to help users who aren't familiar with those words to know what we're on about.</li>
<li><strong>Our Social Media:</strong> On the top of every page, you'll find icons for our main <a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/Scarleteen"><strong>Twitter</strong></a> <span class="print-footnote">[19]</span> account, our <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/scarleteenorg/">Instagram </a> <span class="print-footnote">[20]</span></strong>account, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Scarleteen/15025045594"><strong>Facebook page</strong></a> <span class="print-footnote">[21]</span>, and our <a href="http://hellyeahscarleteen.tumblr.com/"><strong>Tumblr</strong></a> <span class="print-footnote">[22]</span>. We'd love to connect with you that way. You'll also see an icon -- the orange one -- for our RSS feed if you want to be able to get notified through an RSS feed of any new articles, blog entries or advice columns as they're added.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can always get back to<strong> <a href="http://www.scarleteen.com/">the front page</a> <span class="print-footnote">[23]</span></strong> by clicking on the Scarleteen logo in the upper left corner of every page or the home link at the bottom of every page in the red block.</p>
<hr />
<p>Let's try finding some information, so you can see how this can work. For example, if what you came here wanting to know was what you needed to do to practice <a href="https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#safer_sex" title="Practices which aim to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections, such as use of condoms and other latex/nonlatex barriers, regular testing for infections and limiting the number of sexual partners. It&#039;s &quot;safer&quot; instead of &quot;safe&quot; because these practices can reduce risks greatly, but cannot remove all risk." class="lexicon-term">safer sex</a> <span class="print-footnote">[24]</span>, the first thing you could do was look at that top white navigation bar. You can figure out that a couple of those sections are most likely to have what you need, like the Sexual Health section, or the sexuality section, and indeed, both have that information. <strong>OR</strong>, you could use the tags on the bottom of every page, or the tag page that has all of them, and click the tag that says <a href="http://www.scarleteen.com/tags/safer_sex">"safer sex."</a> <span class="print-footnote">[25]</span> That will give you a list of every article, blog post, page and advice question that deals with safer sex. <strong>OR</strong>, you could input "safer sex" into the <a href="http://www.scarleteen.com/search/node">search window</a> <span class="print-footnote">[26]</span>, and that would also give you a long list of relevant articles, answers and resources.</p>
<p>In the case that you can't find exactly the answer you need already here, you can always ask it either at the message board or through the Questions and Answers section. We're also always happy on the boards, live chat or through our text service to set our readers up with a list of links to suit their needs.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>And that's that!</strong> You should easily have a handle on getting around Scarleteen, and we hope you're able to find all you need here. Should you be on the lookout for something you need pertaining to sexuality that isn't on the site, by all means, drop us a line, using the "contact us" link in the red box below, and share your suggestion with us. Scarleteen's content has always been based in responding to user-expressed needs, so we're always open to new ideas and always want to make sure the site is as useable and useful for everyone as it can be.</p>
