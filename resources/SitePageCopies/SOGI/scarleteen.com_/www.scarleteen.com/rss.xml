Here&amp;#039;s a starter guide for those in the United States, as well as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the UK, South Africa and India.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Talking to parents or guardians about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#birth_control&quot; title=&quot;Any number of methods people use to intentionally prevent unwanted pregnancy, including the condom, the cervical barrier, the implant, the patch, the pill, the rhythm method, the ring, the shot, the IUD, spermicide and withdrawal.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;birth control&lt;/a&gt; can be really intimidating, and if you’re wondering what you should do — you’re not alone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;You may be looking into birth control because you’re thinking about becoming — or already are — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexually_active&quot; title=&quot;Someone who has had or is currently having some kind of genital sex with a partner or partners.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexually active&lt;/a&gt; in ways where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#pregnancy&quot; title=&quot;The state of carrying a developing embryo or fetus within the uterus. Medically, someone is considered to be pregnant when an egg has been fertilized by sperm, cells divide, and the fertilized egg is implanted within the lining of the uterus.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; is a risk. Or, you might be looking into methods of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#contraception&quot; title=&quot;Devices, medications or behaviors used to intentionally aim to prevent pregnancy, including the condom, the cervical barrier, the implant, the patch, the pill, the rhythm method, the ring, the shot, the IUD, spermicide and withdrawal.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;contraception&lt;/a&gt; to address health issues, like painful periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Hopefully, the primary people in your life are supportive of your interest in birth control, especially if you’re a minor or otherwise don’t have full legal rights. But sometimes using birth control, for whatever our reason, is not something our parents or guardians support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;You should be trusted to make these decisions, and you deserve access to the resources you need. And while some teens can and do involve their parents, as Scarleteen has pointed out before, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/politics_pregnancy_parenting/judicial_what_the_trials_tribulations_and_basis_of_the_judicial&quot;&gt;those who don’t often aren&#039;t for good reasons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;If you know birth control is right for you but can’t — or just don’t want to — involve your parents or guardians, accessing methods may be easier than you think! I want to help you learn how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your support network&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Confiding in others with private information — like whether you’re sexually active or thinking of starting a method of birth control — is a decision that is entirely yours to make. You don’t have to involve anyone other than medical professionals in this if you don’t want to. But if there’s a supportive person in your life who you trust (like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#partner&quot; title=&quot;In a sexual context, a person with whom someone is having some kind of sex. The term &amp;quot;partner&amp;quot; can be used for all kinds of relationships, not just serious ones. &amp;quot;Partner&amp;quot; can also mean the person someone is with in a romantic or familial partnership.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;partner&lt;/a&gt;, friend, or family member), and who you know will respect your privacy, sometimes involving them can lessen the burden you may experience through the process. They may be able to help you with transportation, money, or just by providing a shoulder to lean on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accessing birth control as a minor in the United States&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;For some, involving our parents or guardians can prevent us from accessing the healthcare we need entirely. Others may not have a way to involve them even if they would provide support and help. The good news is that certain clinics in the U.S. will allow you to access birth control without parental &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#consent&quot; title=&quot;To agree to do something or give permission. In the context of sex, a person is giving full consent/is consenting when they freely and actively agree to do something sexual with someone else; however, the person still has the right to change their mind at any point. A person is NOT consenting if they do not actively agree, have been forced or pressured in some way or are in a state where they are incapable of full consent (such as when asleep, under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or below the age of consent).
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;consent&lt;/a&gt; or notification &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; for &lt;b&gt;free&lt;/b&gt;.  &lt;div class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;quotecontent&quot;&gt; For information about other areas of the world, scroll down! &lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Family planning clinics participating in the federal grant program Title X (pronounced Title Ten) are &lt;b&gt;required&lt;/b&gt; to provide services to legal minors regardless of age, citizenship, or any other socioeconomic status. Those services — which include birth control, pregnancy testing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#breast&quot; title=&quot;Glandular tissue, fat, connective tissue and skin on the chest. &quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;breast&lt;/a&gt; and cervical screenings for cancer, and STD/&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#STI&quot; title=&quot;Sexually transmitted infections: illness, infection and/or disease which is often or can be transmitted through sexual or other intimate contact, like HIV, Chlamydia or Herpes. Some people call STIs STDs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;STI&lt;/a&gt; testing and treatment — are confidential, which means they won’t contact your parents, and you don’t need their permission to access them. These clinics can also provide some degree of pregnancy options counseling, but keep in mind that under current&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/09/09/756103421/doctors-say-federal-rules-on-discussing-abortions-inhibit-relationships-with-pat&quot;&gt; law&lt;/a&gt;, they aren’t allowed to talk to you about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#abortion&quot; title=&quot;A procedure to intentionally end a pregnancy before a birth. Miscarriage is also sometimes called &amp;quot;spontaneous abortion,&amp;quot; even though it is usually not intended.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;HK Gray, a storyteller with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://abortionfunds.org/&quot;&gt;National Network for Abortion Fund&lt;/a&gt;’s Youth Testify leadership program and &lt;a href=&quot;https://advocatesforyouth.org/&quot;&gt;Advocates for Youth&lt;/a&gt;’s 1 in 3 campaign, told Scarleteen that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Even though I was already making independent reproductive decisions when I became a teen mom, I wasn&#039;t allowed to get birth control from my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#OBGYN&quot; title=&quot;A physician who specializes in obstetrics and gynecology; in the reproductive and sexual health of people with a vulva, including providing care with pregnancy, contraception, sexually transmitted infections and menstrual, vulval or vaginal issues and concerns.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;OB/GYN&lt;/a&gt; without parental consent. I didn&#039;t know about Title X clinics where I could have gotten birth control as a minor. And since my dad was experiencing homelessness and my mom was on the run from the law, it wasn’t an option for me to involve them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contraception options&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Title X clinics provide the full range of safe, available and effective birth control options, including long acting reversible contraception methods (LARCs) — like IUDs (such as Mirena or Paragard) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#the_implant&quot; title=&quot;Usually, a hormonal contraceptive implant, a long-term from of birth control which is inserted beneath the fat layer of the arm.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;the implant&lt;/a&gt; (Nexplanon). These options can last for years, and can be good methods if you want a form of birth control that’s both highly effective and easily concealable. LARCs have a 99% success &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/2012/05/24/new_study_finds_longacting_contraceptives_much_more_effective_than_p&quot;&gt;rate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Title X clinics also provide other options like contraceptive pills, the Depo-provera shot, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#the_patch&quot; title=&quot;A hormonal form of birth control that is a stick-on patch put on the skin (anywhere except on the breasts) once a week.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;the patch&lt;/a&gt;, Nuvaring, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#emergency_contraception&quot; title=&quot;A method of contraception used to prevent pregnancy after sex or rape has already occurred, rather than used before or during, like most types of contraception.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;emergency contraception&lt;/a&gt;. To learn more about the birth control options available, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/sexual_health/birth_control_bingo&quot;&gt;Birth Control Bingo&lt;/a&gt; guide Scarleteen provides! You can talk to Scarleteen staff in our direct services if you want more personal help, or you can determine which method or methods may be right for you with the staff at the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How much will it cost? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;For most young people, it won’t cost anything: &lt;b&gt;both your visit and your birth control will be completely free&lt;/b&gt;. When you call to make an appointment, you’ll be screened for financial assistance, which is determined by how much money &lt;b&gt;you&lt;/b&gt; make or have, &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; how much your parents do. If you’re not working, you just say you don’t have an income! And even if you are working, it can still be low cost or free. If you have insurance, you don’t need to provide them with that information if you don’t want to, for any reason; and it can be a better option for maintaining your privacy, too, since no insurance claims will be submitted on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to make an appointment at a Title X clinic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h6 class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding a clinic:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;You can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://opa-fpclinicdb.hhs.gov/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; search tool to find your nearest Title X clinic. On the results page, you can change the distance on the drop down bar to view more options that may be further away, in case there aren’t any clinics nearby. If you need assistance getting to the clinic, this may be a time where a supportive friend or family member in your life can help. There may be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.google.com/landing/transit/index.html&quot;&gt;bus route&lt;/a&gt; available, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/image1.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: left; width: 250px; height: 331px;&quot; /&gt;Make sure to click on the clinic name and view the birth control options they provide, as there are a few clinics who may not provide what you’re looking for. You’ll also be able to view their hours of operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do I say?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Wondering how to make an appointment? It’s easy! You just need to call and say something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p7&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Hi,I need to make an appointment for birth control without my parents finding out, and I can’t pay for it myself.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;This is when the clinic will screen you for financial assistance, and they’ll also ask you for some personal information, like a home address and phone number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Remind them not to send any mail to the address you give them. If you’re still concerned about your parents finding out even if they don’t, you can also provide the address of someone else you know. &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/image2.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: right; width: 250px; height: 415px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 class=&quot;p9&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do I bring?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;All you need to bring with you is a form of identification if you have one, but you won’t be turned away if you don’t! You also won’t be asked to provide any kind of proof of income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I can’t access a Title X clinic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;People under the age of 18 in the United States who have Medicaid, with the exception of CHIP, can access birth control at any clinic that provides it. But if privacy is a concern, this may not be the best option since services can show up on insurance claims which your parents may have access to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;You can also likely access birth control at any &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-greater-texas-family-planning-preventative-health-services/get-involved&quot;&gt;Planned Parenthood&lt;/a&gt; health center &lt;b&gt;if you’re 16-17 years old; supporting yourself, and live apart from your parent or guardian. &lt;/b&gt;Planned Parenthood can provide condoms as well as pregnancy and STI testing at any age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I can’t access any clinic? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Emergency contraception pills (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/birth_control_bingo_emergency_contraception&quot;&gt;Plan B, My Way, Next Choice&lt;/a&gt;) and condoms can be bought online and in grocery stores and pharmacies! It’s over the counter, so you don’t need a prescription — and you can buy Plan B at &lt;a href=&quot;https://ec.princeton.edu/questions/get-EC.html&quot;&gt;any&lt;/a&gt; age in the U.S.! There is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/advice/is_it_really_illegal_to_sell_me_condoms&quot;&gt;no&lt;/a&gt; age restriction on condoms, either. Most pharmacies also carry contraceptive sponges and spermicides, which are also available without a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;You may also be able to order condoms online for free, like through &lt;a href=&quot;http://texaswearscondoms.com&quot;&gt;Texas Wears Condoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://effectiveinterventions.cdc.gov/en/community-and-structural-level/group-1/condom-distribution/condom-distribution-resources-tools/examples-of-health-department-programs&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; programs in NY and D.C.. Seventeen Magazine has compiled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seventeen.com/love/dating-advice/a12026234/these-are-the-10-best-places-to-get-condoms-for-free/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; list of where else to find them for free, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;How do emergency contraception pills work?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Emergency contraception is proven to prevent pregnancy by delaying or inhibiting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#ovulation&quot; title=&quot;The process in the human menstrual/fertilty cycle where a mature ovarian follicle ruptures and releases an ovum.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;ovulation&lt;/a&gt; and inhibiting the fertilization of an egg. Keep in mind, emergency contraception does not terminate a pregnancy! It will not have any effect on a pregnancy that’s already developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/birth_control_bingo_emergency_contraception&quot;&gt;Birth Control Bingo: Emergency Contraception&lt;/a&gt;, Scarleteen shared that using emergency contraception within 24 hours of unprotected &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual_assault&quot; title=&quot;When someone is attacked, or attacks someone else, in a sexual way. Doing something sexual to someone who does not want that done to them, often by force or threat, or having something done to you sexually by someone else that is not wanted and/or which you have not consented to.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual assault&lt;/a&gt; is 98% effective in preventing pregnancy. If taken within 120 hours, it’s still as much as 75% effective!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;But keep in mind that the manufacturer advises &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.planbonestep.com/faqs/&quot;&gt;against&lt;/a&gt; using it as regular birth control — and taking it can make you feel a little sick, cause spotting, and even delay your next &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#period&quot; title=&quot;The fluid, which contains blood, from the shedding of the uterine lining usually at the end of each fertility cycle. Or, that flow you perhaps may have experienced once while shouting, &amp;quot;Oh thank GAWD!&amp;quot;&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;period&lt;/a&gt;. Some teens who take Plan B become concerned it didn’t work because of this, so taking a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#pregnancy_test&quot; title=&quot;What we tell you to take when you ask us if you&amp;#039;re pregnant. A test that can be done at home or by a healthcare provider to determine pregnancy. Usually a urine test, a pregnancy test measures for a specific hormone, hCG, only produced with pregnancy. &quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;pregnancy test&lt;/a&gt; if you miss your period can give you some relief!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ellanow.com/&quot;&gt;Ella&lt;/a&gt;, which requires a prescription from a doctor, is another form of emergency contraception — and it may be more effective for people who weigh more than 175 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I get emergency contraception online?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yes! &lt;/b&gt;You can buy Plan B from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/My-Choice-Emergency-Contraceptive-Tablet/dp/B01N1UOMJ9&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; Prime by searching for &lt;i&gt;My Choice &lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;My Way&lt;/i&gt;, and it’s only $10. It’s even cheaper to buy it online than in a grocery store or pharmacy. And if it’s unsafe to receive mail like this at home, you can choose to pick it up at an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/primeinsider/tips/amazon-locker-qa.html&quot;&gt;Amazon Locker&lt;/a&gt;. Ella can only be obtained at a clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;quotecontent&quot;&gt;It can sometimes be intimidating to access this type of healthcare, especially if we live in areas where we know friends or family may work or visit the clinic at the same time you do. If this is a concern, ask a nurse when you check into the clinic if you can wait in a private area away from others. And if you need help finding a clinic, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/need_help_now_a_guide_to_scarleteens_direct_services&quot;&gt;direct services&lt;/a&gt; Scarleteen provides to those living internationally! You can chat online, post to the message boards, or submit a question to the advice column.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Those outside the United States can learn about some of their options for accessing birth control below:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;If You&#039;re in Australia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;If you’re between 14-18 years old, you can access birth control method without involving a parent. So if you have Medicare — Australia’s universal health care plan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.humanservices.gov.au/individuals/subjects/how-enrol-and-get-started-medicare/enrolling-medicare&quot;&gt;available to all residents&lt;/a&gt; — you can go to any clinic that provides birth control! But if you’re uncomfortable using your health plan at a private clinic because of privacy reasons, there are low or no cost sexual health clinics that can still provide you with confidential services for contraception, like at these clinics in Victoria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shinesa.org.au/&quot;&gt;Shine SA&lt;/a&gt; also provides free family planning services to anyone under 30 with a Medicare plan at their clinics in South Australia. Their services include: contraception, pregnancy testing and referrals, and STI/STD testing and management. You can call their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shinesa.org.au/health-services/sexual-healthline/&quot;&gt;Sexual Healthline&lt;/a&gt; for questions about birth control, safe sex, and your rights to access the care you need!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Keep in mind that without using your Medicare plan, you’d only have to pay around $30 for a consultation at clinics who provide contraception — but possibly more for certain methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;To find a low cost clinic that provides birth control in your area, you can Google “[your region] + sexual health clinic”. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;In New South Wales, the Family Planning Condom Credit Card program is available for young people under 25 years old. At services displaying “CCC”, you can request a condom credit card to redeem 12 free condoms at any time. Click &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fpnsw.org.au/media-news/news-events/health-promotion-projects/condom-credit-card-project&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;here&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to view participating services in the area!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;If You&#039;re in Canada&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;There is &lt;a href=&quot;http://teenhealthsource.com/birthcontrol/birth-control/&quot;&gt;no age restriction &lt;/a&gt;when accessing birth control in Canada — including at health clinics like Planned Parenthood — and they may even offer you financial assistance. But overall, young people may experience difficulty when attempting to access certain methods of contraception &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cps.ca/en/documents/position/universal-access-to-no-cost-contraception-for-youth-in-canada&quot;&gt;due to high costs&lt;/a&gt;, especially when they can’t risk involving their parents by using insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-11/uobc-bco110419.php&quot;&gt;Unlike Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom,&lt;/a&gt; the full range of contraception isn’t covered through universal healthcare in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;While birth control pills are usually covered, some plans may not provide coverage for the patch or vaginal ring, as the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technology has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cps.ca/en/documents/position/universal-access-to-no-cost-contraception-for-youth-in-canada&quot;&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; they aren’t more effective than contraception pills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;IUDs — like the Mirena and Kyleena — are the only LARC (long acting reversible contraception) available in Canada — but they’re &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cps.ca/en/documents/position/universal-access-to-no-cost-contraception-for-youth-in-canada&quot;&gt;“variably” covered&lt;/a&gt; by insurance because they’re considered devices, and the Implant (Nexplanon) is not available in Canada at all. The diaphragm is also not readily available, as the spermicidal jelly used with the diaphragm &lt;a href=&quot;https://myhealth.alberta.ca/Health/pages/conditions.aspx?hwid=hw237864&quot;&gt;is difficult to purchase&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Emergency contraception can be accessed over the counter at any pharmacy in Canada among the following provinces:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;ul1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Alberta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;British Columbia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Manitoba&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;New Brunswick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Newfoundland and Labrador&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Nova Scotia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Nunavut&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;The Northwest Territories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Ontario&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Prince Edward Island&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Yukon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Keep in mind that in Saskatchewan, emergency contraception is kept behind the counter — you’ll need to ask the pharmacy staff for it. In Quebec, a prescription from a doctor is required. Teens in Quebec who need emergency contraception should seek a local sexual health clinic to access this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Ontario&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Earlier this year, teens in Ontario &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/ohip-plus-changes-birth-control-iud-1.5072420&quot;&gt;lost their ability&lt;/a&gt; to access free birth control, even under their parents own health plan. Under the new changes to OHIP+ — which automatically provides health coverage for all people in Ontario who are 24 years old and under — the only birth control methods covered are older brand contraception pills, emergency contraception, the Depo shot, and the Kyleena and Mirena &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#IUD&quot; title=&quot;Intra-uterine device. A long-term birth control method inserted into the uterus by a healthcare provider. Also called an IUS or IUC.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;IUD&lt;/a&gt;. The non-hormonal IUD, Paragard, and Nuvaring (vaginal ring) are not covered. But young people under 24 can apply for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/drugs/ohipplus/&quot;&gt;Exceptional Access Program&lt;/a&gt;, which provides total coverage for things not covered under OHIP+!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Despite the lack of universal healthcare coverage for contraception, certain sexual health clinics across Canada will provide you with low or no cost birth control options!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The clinics below receive funding specifically so they can provide you with affordable birth control:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ottawa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p11&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ottawapublichealth.ca/en/public-health-topics/sexual-health-clinic.aspx&quot;&gt;Ottawa Public Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Toronto&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;To find another no-cost or low-cost clinic that provides birth control in your area, you can Google “[your province] + sexual health clinic”. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Schools in certain provinces may also offer prescriptions for birth control. And while some doctors in Canada may discourage the use of IUDs in young people, you can read information about the safety behind it &lt;a href=&quot;https://globalnews.ca/news/4242184/teen-birth-control-iud/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;If You&#039;re in India&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Young people in India can access the full range of birth control at public and private health clinics, but education surrounding the available methods may vary. While sterilization is the most popular method, you can learn about other methods you may be interested in by clicking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, some young people in India may find that they will &lt;a href=&quot;http://vikaspedia.in/health/women-health/adolescent-health-1/management-of-adolescent-health/contraception-for-adolescents&quot;&gt;not&lt;/a&gt; be able to access most birth control if you’re not married. But Marie Stopes Family Health Centres — located in Jaipur, Ajmer and Bareilly — provide contraception to anyone for free, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.frhsi.org.in/family-health-center.php&quot;&gt;with the exception of injectable contraception&lt;/a&gt;. (They also provide medical and surgical abortions for a fee!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;And through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.frhsi.org.in/clinical-outreach-team.php&quot;&gt;Clinic Outreach Team&lt;/a&gt; (COT) with The Foundation for Reproductive Health Services — an affiliate of Marie Stopes — access to contraception is provided in rural areas where access may be more limited; in Bihar, Rajasthan, and Uttar Paradesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;The COT is made up of medical professionals who travel to public sites to provide family planning services to those who need it; including birth control options like the IUD, oral contraceptive pills, condoms, and emergency contraception!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;You can also access emergency contraception anywhere it’s sold. It may even be free at public health clinics. And while you can also buy condoms anywhere they’re sold, experiencing &lt;a href=&quot;https://amp.dw.com/en/why-are-condoms-unpopular-in-india/a-41453636&quot;&gt;judgment&lt;/a&gt; during the transaction is something many teens in India experience. If you’re comfortable, this could be a good opportunity to bring someone in your support network. Having someone there with you could make your experience less stigmatizing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;If You&#039;re in New Zealand &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Under &lt;a href=&quot;https://bpac.org.nz/BPJ/2011/april/contraception.aspx&quot;&gt;The Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act&lt;/a&gt;, teens under 16 can consent to birth control without involving their parents. Residents of New Zealand who are under the age of 22 can visit any &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.familyplanning.org.nz/advice/contraception&quot;&gt;Family Planning&lt;/a&gt; to receive confidential care when seeking birth control. Fill out their online form &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.familyplanning.org.nz/clinics/ask-for-an-appointment&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to schedule an appointment with a clinic near you. If you’re needing emergency contraception, you can call and ask their drop-in hours to access it without an appointment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;In New Zealand, a wide range of birth control methods are available and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.familyplanning.org.nz/advice/contraception/contraception-methods&quot;&gt;include&lt;/a&gt;: LARCs — like the IUD, Implant, Depo injection, — contraception pills, barrier methods like condoms, and tubal ligation. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.familyplanning.org.nz/media/304024/fp_youth_cycx7-may-2019.pdf&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; youth contraception pamphlet that Family Planning created to learn more about your options and right to access the care you need!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;If You&#039;re in South Africa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medicalprotection.org/southafrica/advice-booklets/consent-to-medical-treatment-in-south-africa-an-mps-guide/children-and-young-people&quot;&gt;The Children’s Act&lt;/a&gt;, teens over the age of 12 do not need parental involvement when seeking birth control at public health clinics, so long as you show you understand the decision you’re making. In South Africa, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobieg.co.za/medical/contraception-everything-you-need-to-know/&quot;&gt;most popular&lt;/a&gt; methods for birth control are the barrier method (condoms), contraceptive pills, the Depo-Provera and Nur-Isterate injection, IUDs, and sterilization. But the Implant is available, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;The cost is completely free at public hospitals and clinics, but obtaining birth control from a private clinic can range in cost; around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobieg.co.za/medical/contraception-everything-you-need-to-know/&quot;&gt;R90-2100&lt;/a&gt; for hormonal birth control methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;And this year there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://bhekisisa.org/features/2019-03-01-00-birth-control-injection-south-africa-unplanned-pregnancy-tender-delay-bayer/&quot;&gt;been a shortage&lt;/a&gt; of certain birth control in the region — such as hormonal injectables and contraceptive pills — which has unfortunately limited access in some areas. But you can always ask the clinic about what methods of birth control they can offer you in the meantime!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;If You&#039;re in the United Kingdom&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Young people 13 and older can receive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/sexual-health/getting-contraception/&quot;&gt;confidential care&lt;/a&gt; when seeking birth control in the UK. When you seek it out through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception/&quot;&gt;National Health Service&lt;/a&gt; (NHS), the cost for all available options is completely covered. Sexual health clinics among the NHS &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/sexual-health/confidentiality-at-sexual-health-services/&quot;&gt;also&lt;/a&gt; provide pregnancy advice and STI testing. And while the clinic staff may encourage you to involve your parents, it’s still your decision if you do that or not. You won’t be turned away for not telling them. The only time they would be required to break confidentiality is if they were concerned your safety is at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;The NHS provides a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/Sexual%2520health%2520services/LocationSearch/1847&quot;&gt;search tool&lt;/a&gt; to find your nearest provider for contraception. But did you know there’s other places you can go, too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;You can visit any Brook centre — a sexual health charity for young people — for free contraception. Brook states on their website that contraception can be accessed at sexual health clinics, GP surgeries, and GUM clinics. But you can also use their search tool &lt;a href=&quot;https://legacy.brook.org.uk/find-a-service&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to find a Brook centre near you. There are over 400 Brook centres throughout the UK, and their locations include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Emergency contraception such as Levonelle and ella can specifically be accessed for free at the following places, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception/where-can-i-get-emergency-contraception/&quot;&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;ul1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Contraception clinics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://legacy.brook.org.uk/find-a-service&quot;&gt;Brook centres&lt;/a&gt; (a sexual health charity for young people)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Some pharmacies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Most sexual health or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Most NHS walk-in centres and minor injuries units&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Most GP surgeries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Some hospital accident and emergency (A&amp;amp;E) departments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mariestopes.org.uk/other-services/contraception/&quot;&gt;Marie Stopes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bpas.org/more-services-information/contraception/&quot;&gt;bpas&lt;/a&gt; may also provide emergency contraception for a fee. And if you’re 16 or older, you can purchase emergency contraception (EC) from any Boots pharmacy, and it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boots.com/health-pharmacy/womenshealth/morning-after-pill&quot;&gt;totally confidential.&lt;/a&gt; The cost starts at around £15, but can increase depending on the type of emergency contraception you want. Boots &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boots.com/health-pharmacy/womenshealth/morning-after-pill&quot;&gt;provides&lt;/a&gt; four different forms of EC:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;ul1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Ella (can be used up to 120 hours after unprotected sex, and may be a better option for those who weigh more than 175 pounds)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Levonelle One Step&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Boots Emergency Contraception&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Levonorgestrel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;The cost may be covered through the NHS with a prescription from your GP. And you may be able to access it when under 16 this way, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Navigating reproductive health services on our own can be intimidating, but hopefully after reading this guide you feel more prepared for the next step!

 <title>One last birthday card for Scarleteen!</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/one_last_birthday_card_for_scarleteen</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/InSexEdWeTrust_forweb.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: right; width: 400px; height: 400px;&quot; /&gt;I&#039;ve been saving this very wonderful birthday-card-of-sorts from the also-very-wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/relationships_sexual_identity_etc/becoming_out_a_totally_nonexhaustive_step_by_step_guide_to&quot;&gt;Liz&lt;/a&gt; for almost a year now, looking for just the right time to post it.  Seeing as we&#039;re two days away from the end of this 20th year and our next (our 21st!) birthday, it certainly feels like a good time. If you want to help us wrap up this big anniversary year with some support to help us stick around for years to come, you should know about a few cool things going on right now or coming up soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;1) Any &lt;a href=&quot;https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/1433116?code=STPRIMARY&quot;&gt;new donor&lt;/a&gt; this month gets advance access to our new zine!  You can read all about that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/want_a_sneak_peek_at_our_forthcoming_zine_or_us_asking_you_for_an_end_of_the&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;2) For those who can and want to order some great, non-toxic and affordable toys, Kenton at Funkit Toys has made some special just for us -- &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.funkittoys.com/product-page/scarleteen-nofrilldo&quot;&gt;they&#039;re scarlet, even!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- to help support Scarleteen. $10 from every $24 dildo and $18 from every $40 model go to us, and you can even add an extra donation while you&#039;re there if you&#039;re feeling extra generous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;3) At the end of the month, there will be opportunities for two more donors to win &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Scarleteen/status/1204440666673205250&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this big prize&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;! -&lt;em&gt; Heather&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;If you had told me fifteen years ago that I&#039;d be doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; education as a job I&#039;d probably have laughed at you. Can you imagine: &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; telling &lt;em&gt;others&lt;/em&gt; that you can have a healthy sexual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#relationship&quot; title=&quot;Some kind of ongoing interaction or association with another person, place or thing.

There are all kinds of relationships: family relationships, friendships, romantic relationships, and sexual relationships. Sometimes there is an overlap where we have more than one kind of relationship with someone. Sometimes people use the word relationship to only mean a romantic, &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot;, or committed relationship, even though that&amp;#039;s not all this word means.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;relationship&lt;/a&gt; with your body, let alone admitting it to &lt;em&gt;myself&lt;/em&gt;!? A lot has changed since then for me – the Liz of today is more confident, more comfortable with herself (not to mention finally grew boobs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;What hasn&#039;t changed in that time is that Scarleteen has remained my #1 sex ed resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;As a young teenager who&#039;d only really seen potential versions of herself on websites that, as a minor, I had to lie to gain access to, finding a site that was not only age-appropriate but that never talked down to me just because I was young changed the way I thought: about both the sex I could one day have, and the types of relationships I might form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;I don&#039;t consider myself to have been &quot;born a boy,&quot; but it&#039;s nevertheless the way that a lot of people saw me as I was growing up. When facing down the barrel of expectations that brought along with it, I sought out a new set of expectations and ideas altogether. When I was stuck, or alone, or scared, it felt good knowing there was a place online I could turn to for help, and for support that I was even allowed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Many years later, as I&#039;m in the process of finding family of my own and learning from a whole new generation of young &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#queer&quot; title=&quot;In the context of sexuality, a broad term for sexual orientation that can describe any number of orientations which are not heterosexual. People who identify as queer may be bisexual or pansexual, gay or lesbian, questioning, asexual or more. &quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;queer&lt;/a&gt; people, it&#039;s an extraordinary privilege to be helping contribute to the same annals of advice that I sought comfort from, and that helped shape me into the adult I am today. I&#039;ve no shame in admitting they still do, too! Sex ed has no age limit, and as I revisit Scarleteen&#039;s pages now I still find myself learning and growing. That&#039;s not to say that it&#039;s perfect, or that every topic has been covered: I&#039;m excited for what another twenty years will bring!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;No birthday is complete without presents, and I believe the biggest gift you can give to yourself is the time and opportunity to explore what you want from life, love, sex, romance and relationships – whether that&#039;s all of them all the time, or only a few of them some of the time, thank you very much! To know that there are folk of every &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender&quot; title=&quot;Characteristics that are seen or presented as distinguishing between male and female in a society. Gender may or may not include assigned or chosen: social roles, feelings, behaviors and/or presentation or appearance.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt; and sexuality under the sun looking for a bit of guidance, or a word of love, and to be able to tell them that I have stood where they stand and survived is a humbling thing, just as I was told by the queers before me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;We all have to start learning somewhere, but we also have so much room to keep learning; to continue on a journey of knowledge about sexual health, practices and pleasure, and especially about ourselves and our own bodies. I will always be thankful for the tools that Scarleteen gave a scared young me, for the tools it continues to give me as a (for the most part) less scared older me, and for the tools I get to help build for the hundreds of thousands who access these pages every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/happy_20th_f_birthday_scarleteen&quot;&gt;Happy birthday Scarleteen&lt;/a&gt;, and here&#039;s to many more decades online!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Let Your Representatives Know: It&#039;s Time to Fund Comprehensive Sex Education!</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/sam_w/let_your_representatives_know_its_time_to_fund_comprehensive_sex_education</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I had the chance to attend an inaugural &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; education policy convening in Washington, D.C. , sponsored by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://siecus.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexuality Information and Education Counsel of the United States&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (SIECUS), with a host of other amazing sex educators and advocates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;SIECUS &amp;quot;I Heart Sex Ed&amp;quot; graphic&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/v9wh2OOa_400x400.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float: right; width: 400px; height: 400px;&quot; /&gt;One of the reasons we all came to D.C. was to do a day of advocacy for sex education on capitol hill. Specifically, we were talking to representatives and asking them to co-sponsor two bills: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hr2720&quot;&gt;The Real Education for Healthy Youth Act&lt;/a&gt; (REHYA)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hr2701&quot;&gt;The Youth Access to Sexual Health Services Act&lt;/a&gt; (YASHS)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do those bills do, and why were we advocating for them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REHYA would create the first ever federal funding stream for comprehensive sex education. That’s right, &lt;em&gt;the first&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bills like REHYA have been introduced before, but never passed. Instead administrations, including the current one, continue pouring a bunch of money into abstinence programming (or “sexual risk avoidance” programs, which are just abstinence-only programs with a longer, sneakier name). You know, those programs that have been shown time and again to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2017/abstinence-only-until-marriage-programs-are-ineffective-and-harmful-young-people&quot;&gt;ineffective and often actively harmful&lt;/a&gt;? REHYA would not only direct money towards medically accurate, comprehensive sex education, it would also put measures in place to prevent any more funds from being wasted on abstinence-only programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YASHA’s goal is to break down barriers that prevent already marginalized young people — like young people of color, immigrant youth, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#LGBTQ&quot; title=&quot;L = lesbian, G = gay, B = bisexual, T = transgender, Q = queer or questioning. Additional letters sometimes added include U = unsure, I = intersex, P = pansexual, A= asexual, S = straight allies.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;LGBTQ&lt;/a&gt; youth, youth in foster care, homeless youth, and young people in juvenile detention — from accessing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual&quot; title=&quot;About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; and reproductive health care they need. It’s a logical companion to REHYA, because even for people who get comprehensive sex education, if their access to sexual health services is limited — or doesn’t exist, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#period&quot; title=&quot;The fluid, which contains blood, from the shedding of the uterine lining usually at the end of each fertility cycle. Or, that flow you perhaps may have experienced once while shouting, &amp;quot;Oh thank GAWD!&amp;quot;&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;period&lt;/a&gt; — that information can only do so much for them. Knowing you need to get an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#STI&quot; title=&quot;Sexually transmitted infections: illness, infection and/or disease which is often or can be transmitted through sexual or other intimate contact, like HIV, Chlamydia or Herpes. Some people call STIs STDs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;STI&lt;/a&gt; screening can’t do you much good if you lack the resources, be they transportation, money, safe and supportive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#adults&quot; title=&quot;People older than you who probably drive you batty. Or, people whose age in years exceeds the legal age of majority; people considered to be adults by law.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;adults&lt;/a&gt;, or basic control over your daily life, to access that screening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see the difference inclusive, accurate sex education makes every day with our users first-hand, and the hurdles many of them still face when it comes to accessing basic sexual healthcare. We’ve watched with frustration as funding pools for comprehensive sex education have remained small, while abstinence-only programming stays flooded with cash. These policies would be an immense breath of fresh air, and would also signal a long-overdue change in how sex education has usually been approached in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more personal level, I live in a rural area in a state whose sex education policies are inconsistent at best and barely-there at worst. Even Reno, the nearest big city, faced several months of delays when developing their new sex education curriculum for high schoolers, as there was resistance to the inclusion of a lesson about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender_identity&quot; title=&quot;A person&amp;#039;s own sense of whether and in what sense they feel they might be a man, a woman, neither, a mixture of genders, or another gender entirely.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender identity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual_orientation&quot; title=&quot;A term -- like homosexual, heterosexual, bisexual, queer, straight, lesbian, gay, asexual -- used to describe a person&amp;#039;s usual or current pattern of emotional, romantic and/or sexual attraction to other people in terms of gender.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual orientation&lt;/a&gt;. In order for the lesson to be included it was given a preamble that, while it states that the lesson is taught from an inclusive perspective, makes it seem as though the existence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#queer&quot; title=&quot;In the context of sexuality, a broad term for sexual orientation that can describe any number of orientations which are not heterosexual. People who identify as queer may be bisexual or pansexual, gay or lesbian, questioning, asexual or more. &quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;queer&lt;/a&gt; and trans people is a matter of opinion and not, you know, the lived experience of people who may very well be existing right there in the classroom where the preamble is being read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RHEYA would prevent situations like what happened in Reno. If funds are put towards inclusive, accurate programming, youth in locations that would otherwise have crummy, harmful, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#exclusive&quot; title=&quot;Something that is not divided or shared with others; which excludes others based on a given criteria.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;exclusive&lt;/a&gt; sex education will actually stand a chance of getting the inclusive information they need without things like caveats to appease the close-minded.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Pussypedia: A Bilingual, Body-Positive, Inclusive Digital Space</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/article/bodies_politics_etc/pussypedia_a_bilingual_bodypositive_inclusive_digital_space</link>

(Not Zoe!)  We talked to her to find out all about this new resource and Zoe&amp;#039;s experience making it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pussypedia.net&quot;&gt;Pussypedia&lt;/a&gt; is a free, diverse, inclusive, and beautiful community-sourced project launched this year by cofounders &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/youngzokeziah&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Zoe Mendelson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/maria_conejo/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;María Conejo&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with the help of over 200 global volunteers from three different continents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;It’s also completely bilingual - in both Spanish and English, which puts Pussypedia into a league of its own. We’re excited to be connected with them at Scarleteen because they represent a new generation of reproductive justice and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual&quot; title=&quot;About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; health pioneers: intersectional, inclusive and unafraid to challenge old paradigms!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Who knew that a discussion with an ex-boyfriend about squirting would set Zoe on a quest across the internet in search of trustworthy, fact-based sexual health information about her body? (Not Zoe!) This elusive search eventually inspired Zoe and Maria to create Pussypedia. I had a conversation with Zoe to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where did you grow up and where’s home for you now?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;I grew up on the north side of Chicago. I went to college at Barnard in New York and studied Urban Planning. I stayed after I graduated and worked for the city. After that, I started writing and I moved to Mexico where I started doing some ad agency work and my own projects, like a data narrative about drones and a few other things that I just did for fun. My last big project was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pussypedia.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pussypedia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and that has been the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What took you to Mexico?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;My dad and grandfather grew up in Chicago but moved to Mexico. We’re white Jews. Everyone thinks I look Latina but I’m not. There’s actually a big Jewish community here. Fun Fact: the current Mayor of Mexico City, where I live, is also Jewish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How did you build your site?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;I wanted to make Pussypedia, but I didn&#039;t know how. I shopped it around. I tried to get sponsors, but nobody would touch it. Around that time, I was doing a fundraiser after the earthquake in Mexico City, selling these tote bags [for it], and ended up meeting a woman from from Kickstarter who invited me to sell the bags for a new campaign on the platform called “Mexico Creates.” I was honest with them and told her I didn’t really want to do that, but I had another project (which is now Pussypedia). She said, “Let&#039;s do it!” The Kickstarter team was very helpful and guided us through the process. The night before we launched our campaign, they suggested we lower our goal. We were only looking for $8K USD (160,000 pesos), but that was considered high for a Mexican Kickstarter campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;We made the goal in three days. In fact, we ended up almost tripling it -- bringing our total budget to $20K USD. Although that was a lot, we realized it still wouldn’t be enough for the entire project. Originally we thought we&#039;d make a prototype. But then we were like, “Screw it. Let&#039;s just do this.” We had 20,000 bucks which ended up being enough for a developer, the consultants, the website design, hosting...the bare bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;The rest was and has since been the work of volunteers. We’ve partnered with 200 people from all over the world! They have volunteered their time to write, illustrate, edit content, factcheck content, translate, and consult for us on lots of different things. People have collected resources for us and have also helped produce events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;person saying: consentimeinto con sentimiento&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/unnamed.png&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: left; width: 500px; height: 411px;&quot; /&gt;Tell us more about your cofounder, Maria.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;What’s her background and what was role in building Pussypedia? &lt;/b&gt;We were introduced by my brother and became best friends when I moved to Mexico City. I’ve always loved her art work; it confronts the stigmatization and hypersexualization of the female body while celebrating women’s sexuality. Maria’s art reflects liberation, not shame. When I called her up to ask for help with this project, she was all in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Any other people behind the scenes we should know about?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jaquelynjahn&quot;&gt;Jackie Jahn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/michaelryap&quot;&gt;Michael Yap&lt;/a&gt; are two of our other major contributors. Jackie has a PhD in public health from Harvard where she focuses on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender&quot; title=&quot;Characteristics that are seen or presented as distinguishing between male and female in a society. Gender may or may not include assigned or chosen: social roles, feelings, behaviors and/or presentation or appearance.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt; issues. She designed the research process, the fact-checking process (she actually did almost all of it) and was really instrumental in making Pussypedia inclusive. Michael, who is the Head of Product Design at Etsy, led the UX design process for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who did you have in mind when were designing the site? Did you have a specific user in mind?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Everyone! We literally tried to design Pussypedia to be accessible to all people. I also used my teenage self for inspiration because I had an extremely short attention span and I struggled to read long-form content (and still do). My parents were told I had learning disabilities, but I&#039;ve never been formally diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;With all of those things in mind, we do our best to make sure our content is simple, non-distracting, non-&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#triggering&quot; title=&quot;Something which triggers -- elicits or creates -- a traumatic memory or reaction in/for someone who has experienced trauma.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;triggering&lt;/a&gt; and at a sixth grade reading level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;One really important decision we made early on was to work with an Inclusion Consultant, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/daniellesheypuk&quot;&gt;Dr. Danielle Sheypuk (PhD)&lt;/a&gt;. She’s a Clinical Psychologist, Inclusion Consultant, Disability-Advocate, TEDx Speaker and sexpert. After reviewing our site and content, she provided us with a series of recommendations and suggestions that helped us make Pussypedia more inclusive and accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Our goal to be inclusive is also reflected in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e8tFrhCDt77kw2SdMa0a7GNBuzuLxMqzplVADVWZp6w/edit&quot;&gt;writers guide&lt;/a&gt;. Our guidelines require plain, simple and inclusive language. The same guidelines are applied to our visuals. There’s a description of what we want our tone to be in our writers guide: Informal, but informed. Frank but friendly. Calm, but firm. Joyful whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image of a door between two legs&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/_108309021_9fea629f-f9a4-49e1-84ea-2aa4bd2d1b75.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 500px; height: 281px; float: right; margin: 10px;&quot; /&gt;What inspired&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;your choice to use the word “pussy” and the phrase “people with pussies”?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;This was probably one of the important decisions we made. We wanted to make a site that was inclusive of all genders. And the word “pussy” was appealing [to us] because it doesn&#039;t have an actual anatomical definition, so it felt like a blank slate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;We saw this as an opportunity to be expansive and inclusive at the same time. For example, we were able to include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#testes&quot; title=&quot;Reproductive glands of people with penises. They sit outside the body and are contained within the scrotum.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;testes&lt;/a&gt; into our definition of pussy. So far, the decision has been well received; we’ve gotten lots of positive feedback from our readers about our definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;In &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;your own words, what does Pussypedia uniquely offer its users?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;There are a few features that make our site unique. We have an interactive, 3D model. It&#039;s an aggregation of the best of fact-checked reproductive/sexual health content available on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Another unique feature is our use of a footnote system. The purpose is to make it really easy for our readers to follow the information back to the original source(s). By doing this, we hope to empower our readers to be more informed consumers of information -- even if it’s somewhat passively. Eventually, we hope this level of care can become the standard for our readers. We want people to recognize the importance of transparency and fact-based content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;I noticed is that the content on Pussypedia isn’t just translated from English to Spanish; it’s localized and representative of the diversity within the Latinx community.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Yeah! Spanish varies so much and words often mean different things to different people based on where they’re from. We wanted people to write informally, and we wanted it to sound like their voice. The idea was to be informal, but informed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;I didn&#039;t know whether to ask people to defer to more or less localized slang. But then I was just like, screw that. Let everybody use their own. We wanted to get a wide range and a mix but with some of the scientific language being translated, we had to be really careful and more nuanced about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of the many things I appreciate about Pussypedia is the integrity of your content.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;What criteria do you use when you’re sourcing resources for your content? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;We don&#039;t blindly promote or include any and every medical journal article. We want it to be high quality content so we consider variables such as funding, the language being used, the date and accuracy, and who is publishing it. There&#039;s not really a series of hard metrics; there&#039;s a list we use when we have people looking for resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;We have volunteers with diverse skill sets and expertise who go through and vet articles after we’ve sourced and added them. We had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; educators who helped us edit for sex-positive language. We had health and medical professionals who helped us translate medical jargon. We also had public health professionals and academics who verified the correct use and context of scientific language being translated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How did you get connected with Scarleteen?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;My dad’s ex-girlfriend knew Heather &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/the_scarleteen_staff_volunteers&quot;&gt;[the founder of Scarleteen]&lt;/a&gt; and reached out on my behalf. Then I wrote Heather and we [met up]. I knew about Scarleteen, but it wasn’t until I started trying to find reliable sources for our site and trying to curate quality content, that I understood how special and amazing Scarleteen is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us more about the development of your strategic partnership with Scarleteen and how it’s beneficial to readers?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;We believe Scarleteen is truly is the best of the best, so we feel good about being able to refer our readers (who are predominantly Spanish-speaking) to a trustworthy resource. And on the flipside, Scarleteen gets to have some of their content translated by us. At the end of the day, this is all being done totally in service to our readers and the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;It has been inspiring to to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#partner&quot; title=&quot;In a sexual context, a person with whom someone is having some kind of sex. The term &amp;quot;partner&amp;quot; can be used for all kinds of relationships, not just serious ones. &amp;quot;Partner&amp;quot; can also mean the person someone is with in a romantic or familial partnership.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;partner&lt;/a&gt; with Scarleteen and work up close and personal with Heather. Seeing the dedication, commitment to thoughtfulness and the standards that Scarleteen has around the content being created or shared is very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;You’ve hosted a couple of translate-a-thons. What is it and what does that entail? &lt;/b&gt; I’m not sure who was the first to come up with the concept but it’s basically an organized meet-up where a bunch of people come together to translate text and other materials from one language to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Since we had a bunch of stuff that needed to be translated in a short time, I organized two meet-ups and the rest is history. The first one was dedicated to collecting resources for our site; we called it “The Great Internet Pussy Hunt.” The second was dedicated to translating some of Scarleteen’s content from English to Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do you plan to expand or translate content into additional languages?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Yes! We&#039;re really excited and already on our way to translating our site into French. As of right now, we have 10 articles translated. I’m looking for partner publications in French that would be willing to publish Pussypedia. I’ve probably emailed every reproductive health nonprofit and every Francophone country in Africa. We also have volunteers willing to translate in Swahili.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What kind of traction have you had on the site thus far? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;We’ve surpassed 300,000 unique visitors! More than half our readership is coming from Mexico. Naturally, we have visitors from Spanish speaking countries throughout Latin America, including Brazil. We’ve basically had visitors from every country in the world except for Syria, North Korea and Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Of all of those locations, which were you most surprised to see readers coming from? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Tanzania,Thailand, Vietnam and India! It made me really emotional. It&#039;s pretty wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What has been the biggest surprise or lesson learned so far since getting this project off the ground? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;The slow, horrifying realization that I had taken on something that was massive. Way more massive than I ever thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s been the reception of Pussypedia among native Spanish speakers in Mexico, and the rest of Latin America? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;It’s all been really positive. The locals are very receptive and enthusiastic but really, we’re getting a lot of love from all over and we’re so thankful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Which resources are the most popular on your site? And why?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#discharge&quot; title=&quot;In the context of sex and sexual health, any number of fluids which come from the genitals. Plenty of genital discharge is healthy, while some discharges can be symptoms of illness.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;discharge&lt;/a&gt; article is hands down the most popular for sure! I think it’s because everyone has it, but we don’t always talk about it. But it may also be compounded by the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pussypedia.net/articles/wetness-and-discharge-article&quot;&gt;the discharge illustration is awesome&lt;/a&gt;. Runner-ups are probably the articles about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#masturbation&quot; title=&quot;Ways that people seek out and/or experience sexual pleasure by themselves, without a sexual partner.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;masturbation&lt;/a&gt; and sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What&#039;s your favorite thing about Pussypedia?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;That Pussypedia is community-sourced. Every article is written, translated, fact-checked, edited and illustrated by a team of people. People can feel confident knowing that everything they read on our site has been reviewed by at least five people, not just one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s the value to the reader of your site being community-sourced?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;It&#039;s beautiful that all these people gave their time, energy and expertise to making Pussypedia a reality. Everyone contributed because they wanted it to happen for everybody. It&#039;s like one step past the Wikipedia model. I say that because of my role in curation. If you go to Wikipedia, it&#039;s an open-source content model where anyone can add to the content. Ours is more of a more coordinated process that involves quality assurance. *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there anything else you want the Scarleteen readers to know about Pussypedia?&lt;/b&gt; We want it to communicate, without any words, that we’re a resource that is anti-shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Pussypedia is a place where people can come to find reliable information while also experience joy and happiness. Ultimately we want people to love their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;We also do little, tedious things that make a big difference. For example, we do our due diligence on authorship and make sure that all of our content is factual and up-to-date. We are committed to investing extra time and effort into tracing paraphrased content back to its original source/author. We also take into consideration if someone’s research is paid for by big pharma [pharmaceutical corporations] or if it was published independently. We do all of this so our readers don’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;To learn more about Pussypedia, check out their site and/or their social media:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If you have chronic pelvic pain, what do you do if you want to get sexual with yourself or someone else? How can you be physically intimate if you’re in pain? How do you talk to your partners? If it starts hurting, should you stop? This guide from Nicole Guappone offers some great help with all this and more.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;It can be incredibly frustrating when a part of the body we strongly associate with, and expect to give us, pleasure ends up causing us chronic pain. If you have chronic pelvic pain, what do you do if you want to get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual&quot; title=&quot;About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; with yourself or someone else? How can you be physically intimate if you’re in pain? How do you talk to your partners? If it starts hurting, should you stop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;For the last couple of years, I’ve experienced pelvic pain and painful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt;. I know that it can feel like your body is betraying you, that your condition will never improve, or that you’ll never be able to have the kind of sex you might want to have. It can be both physically and emotionally exhausting, especially if you have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#partner&quot; title=&quot;In a sexual context, a person with whom someone is having some kind of sex. The term &amp;quot;partner&amp;quot; can be used for all kinds of relationships, not just serious ones. &amp;quot;Partner&amp;quot; can also mean the person someone is with in a romantic or familial partnership.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;partner&lt;/a&gt; who doesn’t understand. My quality of life is a lot better now that it was two years ago, and I don’t always experience pain with vaginovulvar sex. I’m not glad I had the experience I did, but I did learn a lot about my body, myself and my partner, and I learned how we can communicate better with each other — both about sex and in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;First things first: if you have pelvic pain and sex is the last thing on your mind, that’s totally valid! Maybe your current goal is to be able to stand for long periods of time without your thighs aching. Maybe your biggest concern right now is the constipation that can accompany a tense pelvic floor. Maybe sex (and/or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#masturbation&quot; title=&quot;Ways that people seek out and/or experience sexual pleasure by themselves, without a sexual partner.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;masturbation&lt;/a&gt;) just isn’t your thing anyway. But if it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; and you are struggling to figure things out now that your body doesn’t seem to want to cooperate with you, don’t give up hope. There are ways to still enjoy sexual pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to communicate with partners&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;It can be really difficult to explain chronic pain to someone who has never experienced it. If you don’t know where to start, begin by giving them something like this very article — or my first article about pelvic pain — to read. It will give everyone involved the same language to work with. For example, if you say you want to have sex, what you have in mind may be very different from what your partner has in mind. These are conversations that are important to have in any &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#relationship&quot; title=&quot;Some kind of ongoing interaction or association with another person, place or thing.

There are all kinds of relationships: family relationships, friendships, romantic relationships, and sexual relationships. Sometimes there is an overlap where we have more than one kind of relationship with someone. Sometimes people use the word relationship to only mean a romantic, &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot;, or committed relationship, even though that&amp;#039;s not all this word means.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;relationship&lt;/a&gt;, but they are especially important when chronic pain is involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Try your best to be very clear about how you’re feeling, especially if any of the feelings you have are negative. It is both common and valid to feel frustrated, sad, or angry when you’re trying to be sexual and your body isn’t responding the way you want it to or the way it used to. If you want to be sexual with your partner, but are feeling nervous, anxious or worried about potentially experiencing pain, tell them ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Make sure to tell your partner that these feelings are not about them, but about your pain and/or your body. If you become frustrated, that doesn’t necessarily mean you&#039;re frustrated with them. The same goes for feeling angry or sad. Your partner may decide ahead of time that they aren’t comfortable being sexual with someone who may get upset during sex, even if it is for reasons unrelated to them. That can be really disappointing, but if that’s the case, you have to respect that person’s boundary. Everyone involved should be aware that negative feelings may come up during sex (whether someone has pain or not!), and you’ll have to be prepared to deal with them, either by working through them in the moment or completely stopping intimate activity for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;These conversations might be more difficult than you anticipate. They may take time. They require patience and maturity from everyone involved. Try not to get discouraged if your partner doesn&#039;t understand right away. Maybe &lt;/i&gt;you&lt;i&gt; don&#039;t even understand your own feelings and need some time to process. That&#039;s okay, too. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do I know if I should stop? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;If you want to stop, for any reason — including things that aren’t even about your pain —then by all means, you should stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;When we’re talking about stopping sexual activity (or not) based on physical pain, sometimes it can be difficult to decide whether or not to stop. Every body is different and everyone experiences pain differently, but often it’s possible to tell the difference between pain that only causes temporary discomfort and pain that may cause longer-term harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;If you can’t tell the difference, your safest bet is to just stop. The more you deal with pelvic pain, the better you will get at differentiating between “superficial” pain (pain that is more “surface” level, like tissue friction) and deeper pain (the kind of pain that causes aching and throbbing in the joints, muscles, tendons—deeper parts of the body).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Because I’m not a doctor or medical professional, I can’t tell you what is best for you, but I can explain my own experience. Sometimes when I have vaginal sex, the tissue feels tender. I may need lube or I may need more of other kinds of sex to help my body further relax. Usually there is an underlying pleasure even when I’m experiencing this pain, meaning the sex feels good, but I have some discomfort that I can alleviate by things like deep breathing or adjusting angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Sometimes, though, I’ll try to have vaginal sex and it will be difficult to insert anything or, once something is inserted, thrusting will cause deeper pain, the kind of pain that doesn’t feel like it can be alleviated by minor adjustments. This is when I know I should stop, and that if I try to “push through” the pain, I am most likely causing more harm than good. I want my body to remember that sex can be pleasurable: I don’t want my body to continue to associate vaginal sex with pain. (Remember, a common cause of lingering pain is the body’s anticipation of pain. Our bodies remember pain and they can have long memories. Some physical responses are out of our conscious control.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Again, if you aren’t sure, stop. Pause. Breathe. Decide if you want to continue sexual activity or stop for now. If you are seeing a pelvic pain professional (like a pelvic floor physical therapist), they should be able to talk to you about sexual activity and different types of pain and help you make the decisions best for your body and your situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get to know your own body (again)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;When you experience any kind of chronic pain, your body is bound to change. Don’t be surprised if you don’t like the kinds of touch you used to like or if your body responds differently to touch. These changes may be temporary, or they may be more long-term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Pelvic pain can be internal, external, or both. For a short time, I experienced clitoral pain. While that didn’t last, my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#clitoris&quot; title=&quot;A sexual organ both external and internal on the vulva and inside the pelvis of those assigned female at birth that is similar to the penis, but serves no other known purpose besides providing sexual pleasure.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;clitoris&lt;/a&gt; is still much more sensitive than it used to be. I used to love powerful vibrators; now I sometimes struggle to find toys with vibrations that are gentle enough for me. I don’t know if my body will ever go back to “normal,” or if this is my new normal. I thankfully no longer have clitoral pain, and I am able to find toys that work with my body, but it was definitely unexpected to feel my body change and to need to get “reacquainted” with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Masturbation can be a really important part of rediscovering sex and intimacy when you have pelvic pain. You’ll learn what your body likes now. Plus, becoming more comfortable with your own body’s current needs, limits and desires — and without the extra pressure of needing to consider and communicate with someone else — can make it easier to guide partners you may be getting intimate with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Time is important, whether you&#039;re alone or with someone else. Your body may need space and time to relax and get comfortable. Again, the body remembers, so if your body associates pain with sex, it can tense up and cause even more pain. Though it may be frustrating, being patient and listening to your body will help it overcome that unconscious anticipatory tension. It may sound strange, but if your body “knows” that if it feels deeper pain, you will stop, it will begin to trust you. Pushing through the pain will only make things worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;An important way to prioritize pleasure when you experience pelvic pain is to make sure you have plenty of time, and prepare all of the things you need ahead of time. If you’re using toys, make sure they’re all washed and ready to go. Have your lube and your gloves and/or condoms ready; maybe even a hand mirror if you need to get a good look at yourself. Make sure you’re warm enough: if you’re cold, your body may tense up, which can make it difficult to relax and release muscle tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Be gentle with yourself. You may even need to “re-learn” how to masturbate. I did! I got so used to using sex toys and vibrators to masturbate that when I got too sensitive for toys, I had to go back to basics and masturbate very gently with my fingers. I wore nitrile gloves and used lube to create as little friction as possible. It was frustrating at the time, but now I feel like I have a longer list of ways to experience sexual pleasure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Remember to go in with realistic expectations. Prepare for the need to pause or stop sexual activity altogether. Anticipate the need to communicate directly with your partner about how you feel. You of course can&#039;t prepare for any and all situations that may arise, but understand that things may not go according to plan. This may not sound very sexy or fun, but if you go into a solo or partnered experience with unrealistic expectations, it’s easy to feel discouraged or frustrated when things don&#039;t turn out the way you hoped. Orgasms are great, but sometimes our bodies don’t cooperate—and contrary to popular belief, you don’t &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#orgasm&quot; title=&quot;An event typically in response to physical or intellectual sexual stimulation, controlled by the involuntary nervous system. Orgasm often results in muscle contractions in and around the genitals, other muscular spasms throughout the body, and a feeling of sexual and/or tension release.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;orgasm&lt;/a&gt; to have a pleasurable experience or for sex or masturbation to “count.” Have fun, be communicative, and expect the unexpected. As long as you have fun and experience pleasure, it counts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Think beyond your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#genitals&quot; title=&quot;External sexual or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;genitals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Satisfying, pleasurable sex doesn’t need to involve genitals or internal stimulation (like vaginal or anal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#entry&quot; title=&quot;In a sexual context, when a kind of sex involves someone putting one body part inside the body part of another person, such as with intercourse.  Some people use the word &amp;quot;penetration&amp;quot; instead.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;entry&lt;/a&gt;). Sex is anything that gives you sexual pleasure whether or not it involves the equipment between your legs. In fact, if you start to think about sex as something beyond genital stimulation, suddenly a whole new world opens up before you. There are many more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#erogenous_zones&quot; title=&quot;Various areas of the body with a greater number of sensory nerve receptors than other areas, which people may find particularly sexually stimulating, such as (but by no means limited to) the lips, tongue, palms, fingers, feet, inner thighs, anus, nipples, neck, collarbone, nose, ears, armpits and/or the genitals.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;erogenous zones&lt;/a&gt; on the body: nipples, thighs, neck, lower back, the inside of your elbows. It’s different for everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;A fun game to play with a partner (or even just by yourself!) is one where you go back and forth touching each other on parts of the body that aren’t commonly thought of as sexy or sexual and see how it feels. Tell your partner where you’d like them to touch you. When they do—if they are comfortable with it—tell them how it feels (or let your moans and heavy breathing do some of the talking for you). Better than you thought? Not as good as you expected? This is a great way to find different and surprising erogenous zones on each others bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Full body cuddling can also be intimate and satisfying. Snuggle up under a warm blanket or get close and dance together, letting your hands wander (or not, if you’re not feeling it). Make out, tickle each other, whisper fantasies into each others ears, depending on your pain and/or comfort levels (for instance, tickling may not be a good idea if your pelvic floor muscles are already very tense).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;If you &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; ready to mix some genitals into the equation, &lt;b&gt;consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#mutual_masturbation&quot; title=&quot;When sexual partners masturbate together.  Sometimes people also use &amp;quot;mutual masturbation&amp;quot; to mean manual sex (fingering or handjobs) done at the same time.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;mutual masturbation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Mutual masturbation is usually described as masturbating in front of your partner. Watch each other masturbate or maybe just focus on yourself while you’re both in the same room. Another great way to mutually masturbate, is to “help” each other. This might mean taking turns with each other or it might mean having one hand on yourself and the other on your partner. It can be very sexy and intimate to be stimulating yourself while your partner touches, kisses, or licks various erogenous zones on your body. This is an especially good idea if you’re experiencing pain and aren’t comfortable with someone else touching an area of your body that hurts. This can also be a great way for your partner to see what works for you by watching you touch your own body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;You don’t have to take your clothes off in order to have sex. There were times when I would keep my underwear on when I got intimate with a partner, so they didn’t have to worry about hurting me. This usually involved mutual masturbation and me using a toy on myself over my underwear. This can be a great workaround if you have external pain and skin on skin contact is too much. Remember, just because one of you wears your underwear doesn’t mean you both have to. You get to make all the rules—and change them up whenever you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The need for release&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you’re experimenting and you’re having fun with your partner, but you really feel like you need sexual release. Sexual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#arousal&quot; title=&quot;A state of sexual excitement and interest that sends messages to the brain which create physical changes and sensations, such as increased blood pressure, erection, lubrication, loosening of the vaginal or anal muscles, and increased physical sensitivity.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;arousal&lt;/a&gt; creates some physical tension, so a lack of release can sometimes heighten the pain you already experience. The discomfort caused by increased blood flow, which happens during arousal, is known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#vasocongestion&quot; title=&quot;A swelling of body tissues caused by increased vascular blood flow and a localized increase in blood pressure. Vasocongestion plays a part in erection of the penis and clitoris, vaginal lubrication and menstruation.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;vasocongestion&lt;/a&gt; (you may recognize the slang term “blue balls,” though it can be experienced by everyone with every kind of body parts, not just people with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#testes&quot; title=&quot;Reproductive glands of people with penises. They sit outside the body and are contained within the scrotum.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;testes&lt;/a&gt;). If you give the body some time to “cool down,” this discomfort usually resolves itself. It can also be resolved through orgasm by yourself or with a partner. Some people use it as an excuse to pressure their partner into doing something sexual for them when their partner doesn&#039;t want to--that&#039;s not OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relieving vasocongestion may be easier said than done if you have difficulty reaching orgasm because of pelvic pain. There were times when I had to abstain from orgasms longer than I would have liked to. I had been used to being able to orgasm for any reason (whether sexual release, stress relief, or just for fun) whenever I felt like it. When I started experiencing pelvic pain, my body couldn’t always handle the stimulation needed to induce orgasm. If this happened, I would stop what I was doing and give my body a rest. Usually within a few minutes, my body would start to relax and the need for release would subside. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicines (like naproxen sodium or ibuprofen) can also help vasesongestion subside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone will handle this differently. The reason I bring it up is not to tell you how to deal with it, but to let you know that if this happens to you, you are not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;p7&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Products and devices to ease painful sex&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p7&quot;&gt;There are lots of different gizmos and gadgets out there to help ease pelvic pain. Below are some of my favorites. None of these are necessarily required for treatment of pain. If these products aren&#039;t accessible to you (whether due to cost, lack of privacy, or some other reason), that doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t still heal your body an/or experience sexual pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dilators:&lt;/b&gt; Dilators look like dildos, but some see them as more of a medical device than sex toy. Dilators usually come in sets of three to five and they are meant to insert into the vaginal canal to reintroduce the feeling of something filling it. The smallest is usually the size of a small finger, and they get progressively bigger. This way you can get used to your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#vagina&quot; title=&quot;The internal passage leading from the opening of the vulva to the cervix of the uterus.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;vagina&lt;/a&gt; having something inside of it, often in preparation for internal vaginal sex. If you want to be able to have this kind of sex, a good set of silicone or glass dilators is a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Ohnut:&lt;/b&gt; The Ohnut is a product that seems so simple, it’s a wonder that no one invented it sooner! But when you take a closer look, you can tell just how much thought and care was put into the creation of this device. Ohnut is an adjustable device made up of four interlocking rings that are placed at the base of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#penis&quot; title=&quot;One of the two external reproductive organs of people assigned male at birth.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;penis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#dildo&quot; title=&quot;An insertive sex toy that usually looks more or less like a penis (but can sometimes bear little resemblance) and is usually made from silicone or rubber, but can also be made with glass, wood, metal, or any number of innovative materials. Come in an endless variety of sizes, shapes, and colors. &quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;dildo&lt;/a&gt;, or dilator to create a buffer between bodies (or toys and bodies) to customize the depth of entry. You can use one ring or all four, that’s the beauty of Ohnut! This will not work for all kinds of pelvic pain, but if you have pain deeper inside, this may help. Ohnut was created for bodies with vaginas (including neovaginas) but it may also be used for anal entry as well. You can read my full review of the Ohnut &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.allure.com/story/ohnut-wearable-painful-sex-does-it-work-review&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sex toys: &lt;/b&gt;There really is something out there for everyone. The best way to find something that will work for you, especially if you have pelvic pain, is to go to a shop in person and handle the products. Progressive, feminist, and/or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#queer&quot; title=&quot;In the context of sexuality, a broad term for sexual orientation that can describe any number of orientations which are not heterosexual. People who identify as queer may be bisexual or pansexual, gay or lesbian, questioning, asexual or more. &quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;queer&lt;/a&gt;-owned sex toy shops are known for their bright lights, educated staff, and floor samples of toys that you can turn on and fondle in person. If you don’t have access to a shop like that, there are some great online retailers that are just an internet search away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;You can find dildos of all shapes and sizes and vibrators of all power levels. Everybody has a butt (yay butt plugs!) and vibrators are great for both penises &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; vulvas. There are even some fantastic independent toy makers out there who offer lots of different sizes and firmnesses of their toys so if you’re looking for something small and soft in particular, your best bet is a small independently owned company. Some creators have even started offering penis sleeves. While sex toy manufacturers have historically focused on creating toys for people with vaginas, now people with penises have more choices than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;A note on size: &lt;/b&gt;Don’t let mainstream media make you feel bad or dictate your preferences for you. We’re often told bigger is better, that we should aspire to the largest dildos and want the most powerful vibrators. These are the kinds of toys that get the most reviews, but the truth is that toys like that don’t work for many of us. You’re not weak if super powerful vibrators hurt and you’re not missing out on anything if you can’t handle huge dildos. The more you listen to and trust your body, the more pleasurable your experiences will be no matter the size or power level of your toys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p7&quot;&gt;What is important is that you listen to your body and be patient with yourself. Pelvic pain is not an easy thing to deal with, especially when you feel like you can&#039;t talk about it with others the same way you might talk about a different kind of chronic pain. You may feel disconnected from or betrayed by your body. This is normal. You may feel like you’re too young to experience painful sex or painful orgasms, but people of any age or genital makeup can experience pelvic pain. You are not alone. Don’t think of this as a problem to overcome but an experience to learn how to deal with. It could be short term or long term, it may come and go. Remember that there will be ups and downs. The good news is, we are making advances daily in understanding pelvic health and there are lots of us out there working hard to normalize and facilitate conversations surrounding pelvic pain and sexual health.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Want a Sneak Peek at Our Forthcoming Zine? (Or, us asking you for an end of the year donation and offering enticements.)  </title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/want_a_sneak_peek_at_our_forthcoming_zine_or_us_asking_you_for_an_end_of_the</link>

If your inbox has been anything like mine, you&#039;ve already suffered through a solid week of targeted marketing landmines and nonstop sparkly coercions to spend money buying everything and anything on earth, no less. So, I&#039;m going to do us all a solid and keep it simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s the end of the year -- also the end of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/happy_20th_f_birthday_scarleteen&quot;&gt;our 20th anniversary year&lt;/a&gt;, something any fully independent, feminist, grassroots nonprofit, let alone one focused on progressive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; education for young people, rarely survives to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have it to give, and you&#039;d like to give it to us, &lt;a href=&quot;https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/1433116?code=STPRIMARY&quot;&gt;we&#039;re asking for some financial support from yo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://donatenow.networkforgood.org/1433116?code=STPRIMARY&quot;&gt;u&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;We intend to use that support the way we usually do, to fund all of the things we&#039;ve done over the last 20+ years and want to keep doing like:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Making and publishing the kind of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/its_quickies_our_new_series_of_short_fast_sex_ed_summaries&quot;&gt;creative&lt;/a&gt;, progressive, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/disability&quot;&gt;inclusive&lt;/a&gt; (and in so many ways!), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/sexuality&quot;&gt;affirming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/advice&quot;&gt;caring&lt;/a&gt; sex, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual&quot; title=&quot;About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; health and relationships content that our readers ask for, want and need; content and approaches to sex education that have also helped to move the field of sex ed forward over the last 20+ years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Providing one-on-one services to our users through our moderated message boards, text/SMS helpline, live chat and advice columns, as well as some in-person outreach, all given by real, live people -- not bots -- and whose responses are original and responsive, not pre-written scripts so common in many digital/online help services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Supporting and amplifying other great sex and relationships education, content and actions from all around the world, from all kinds of people, in our content, direct services and all &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Scarleteen/&quot;&gt;our&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Scarleteen&quot;&gt;social&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://hellyeahscarleteen.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;media&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/scarleteenorg/&quot;&gt;channels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Making or taking part in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/wait_what_its_finally_here_it_is&quot;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; and other kinds of print media projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On that note, we&#039;d like to offer new donors in the next month the little gift we&#039;re given to our current donors:&lt;/strong&gt; a new, interactive, printable zine!*&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ll be releasing the zine for free to everyone come the new year, but if you&#039;d like to get it early, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; help us keep on keepin&#039;on, it&#039;s yours now with &lt;a href=&quot;https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/1433116?code=STPRIMARY&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;any one-time donation of $20 or more, or any new recurring donation of $10 a month or more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#039;re welcome to use it for yourself, for your family, or, if you teach sex ed, to use it with whomever you teach. You can even take pictures of it and brag about how gobstoppingly righteous and adorable it is online, if you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;a teeny sample of the zine!&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/iamawesome.png&quot; style=&quot;margin: 5px; width: 350px; height: 168px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;I don&#039;t want to say too much about it yet, mostly because it&#039;s fun to have a secret, but also because we want to wait to say more until it&#039;s available to everyone. But I can tell you now that: 1) it&#039;s seriously awesome, just like you (&lt;em&gt;awwww&lt;/em&gt;), 2) one of our amazing staff, Al Washburn, came up with it a couple years ago and we&#039;ve been using a version of it in our in-person outreach for a while, 3) this updated version includes rad new illustrations from &lt;a href=&quot;https://archiebongiovanni.com/&quot;&gt;Archie Bongiovanni&lt;/a&gt;, and 4) it is going to be very hard for you not to pass this around everywhere so almost everyone you know can use it, which is great, because come 2020, our hope is that&#039;s &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what everyone does with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That&#039;s it!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If you can donate, &lt;a href=&quot;https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/1433116?code=STPRIMARY&quot;&gt;here&#039;s where you go to do that!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  All of us here at Scarleteen fling our enduring gratitude in your general direction!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can&#039;t, we certainly understand. Know that we stand with and for you in what are likely long-frustrated wishes for pay equity, fewer people to take care of with little to no help, and catching a break for a change, for crying out loud. &lt;3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wish everyone a great rest-of-2019, and, presuming you&#039;ve all had the decade many of us have around here, we wish that the next one is considerably better. Kudos to all of us for making it through: it sure hasn&#039;t been easy. Here&#039;s to a new decade of all the good things, very much including all the great sex and relationships education all of our hearts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#desire&quot; title=&quot;A feeling of strongly wanting something. In the context of sex, desire can be a strong feeling of a physical and psychological want for any kind of sex.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;desire&lt;/a&gt; for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* Some fine print:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Be sure when you donate that you use a current, working email so you can get your copies! &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;After you make your $10+ recurring donation or your $20+ one-time donation, we&#039;ll email you the files -- one for print, one for digital-only use -- within 3 days. If you don&#039;t hear from us by then, check your spam folder. If we&#039;re not hiding in there, you can email us at: feedbackAT scarleteenDOTcom.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

It gave me a chance to sit with myself, who I thought myself to be, who I thought I was going to become, and who I really was.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;I see &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; with the tear-stained cheeks. &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt;, with your legs crossed in front of your full-length mirror. &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; with the repetitive, “If only I’ds--.” &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; with the fearful doubt of any future partnered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual&quot; title=&quot;About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; experiences and relationships. &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt;, after you received your diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I empathize with your self-loathing and shame. I understand the negotiation between your ever-present confusion and your desperation for answers. I know what it’s like to question your value in your friendships, relationships, and your purpose in this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;“This looks herpetic.” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 22 years old, I was diagnosed with genital herpes. Although the herpes simplex virus (HSV) is not a life-threatening &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#infection&quot; title=&quot;When harmful microbes, or germs, or harmful levels of microbes/germs, enter the body and multiply, causing illness. The common cold, flu viruses, sexually transmitted infections, chickenpox, impetigo, rabies and diphtheria are some kinds of infections.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;infection&lt;/a&gt;, I felt as though my life was over as soon as the words left the nurse’s lips. My diagnosis quickly equated itself with a relationship’s death sentence. “I knew better,” I thought to myself. As someone with an undergraduate background in human sexuality, the stigma repurposed itself in a reflection of my intended career. I questioned my worth in the sexuality field. I stopped going to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped investing in my self-worth. I buried my sexuality. I buried myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although much of what I knew my purpose to be was placed in limbo, I unknowingly found a resurgence of self through research. My then-&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#partner&quot; title=&quot;In a sexual context, a person with whom someone is having some kind of sex. The term &amp;quot;partner&amp;quot; can be used for all kinds of relationships, not just serious ones. &amp;quot;Partner&amp;quot; can also mean the person someone is with in a romantic or familial partnership.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;partner&lt;/a&gt; wanted nothing to do with my findings, but I became consumed. Forums, blogs, social media, research journals, and government agencies—it didn’t matter. I wanted to know everything and anything about herpes and its stigma. My in-bed-by-8 PM bedtime routine was replaced with researching until 2 AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned about the different types of herpes, and that HSV-1, the virus most commonly associated with cold sores, could be transmitted genitally as genital HSV-1. I learned that HSV is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8157/&quot;&gt;member of the virus family that causes chicken pox and mono&lt;/a&gt; (aka &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8157/&quot;&gt;herpesviradae&lt;/a&gt;). I learned that I would likely not know the type of herpes that I had until those antibodies could be detected through my blood work. I learned that those results really didn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned that the person who I &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; wanted to be there for me, the person that I hoped would answer all of my questions, the person that I hoped would answer my late-night call, the person I hoped would be there with me until the end, wasn’t someone that I could depend on in the long-term. Along with accepting my herpes status, I came to accept that this person didn’t serve a place in my life. As he made his exit, I slowly re-centered myself. His absence unveiled a longing for something that was bigger than my being. Something that I felt that every herpes and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#STI&quot; title=&quot;Sexually transmitted infections: illness, infection and/or disease which is often or can be transmitted through sexual or other intimate contact, like HIV, Chlamydia or Herpes. Some people call STIs STDs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;STI&lt;/a&gt; positive person should know, accept, and welcome. &lt;em&gt;Something like this…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learn to Manage Your Outbreaks, Not Fear Them &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t let the Instagram advertisements and comments convince you otherwise. There is currently no cure for the herpes simplex virus—but it’s also nothing to fear. Although there is currently no cure for herpes, it is manageable. Since my diagnosis in July 2015, I remained asymptomatic until early 2019. 2019, a year defined by an ex-partner’s unemployment combined with the responsibilities of full-time job, an internship, graduate school coursework and an eventual breakup; a year summarized through perpetual stress and emotional upheaval. As I reflect upon 2019, it’s unsurprising that this is the year with the most symptomatic outbreaks, as stress is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#trigger&quot; title=&quot;In the context of behavior, a trigger is an experience that triggers a traumatic memory in someone who has experienced trauma.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;trigger&lt;/a&gt; for herpes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each person will experience their own set of triggers — things that cause felt or visible symptoms, including outbreaks — and symptoms. Some of those will reach the surface while others will remain asymptomatic. Regardless of what &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; triggers might be, it’s important to allocate time during outbreaks to self-care. Instead of viewing an outbreak as a burden or dreadful experience, I’ve come to recognize them as reminders to slow down and allocate additional time for &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;. Sometimes this looks like taking a bubble bath, while other times this looks like curling up in bed with my cat, fluffy pillows, and a good book. Outbreaks can present an opportunity to experience ourselves and celebrate our bodies in a new light if we learn to look beyond the stigma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don’t Settle &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re first diagnosed with herpes, or any sexually transmitted infection (STI), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; and dating can feel daunting, limited, and nearly, if not, impossible. Whether you’re in a committed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#relationship&quot; title=&quot;Some kind of ongoing interaction or association with another person, place or thing.

There are all kinds of relationships: family relationships, friendships, romantic relationships, and sexual relationships. Sometimes there is an overlap where we have more than one kind of relationship with someone. Sometimes people use the word relationship to only mean a romantic, &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot;, or committed relationship, even though that&amp;#039;s not all this word means.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;relationship&lt;/a&gt;, are almost dating, or single, finding the “right” words to disclose often falls short. &lt;i&gt;“They’ll think I cheated on them. They’ll never understand. Where do I even start? What if it originated with them? I don’t want them to feel this pain. What if they no longer want to see or spend time with me? What if I’m not enough…”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/EHLEj4eWoAAeRSI.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px 14px; width: 500px; height: 490px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;Dating websites made exclusively for folks with STIs might be tempting. They’re marketed as safe spaces for STI-positive folks to find love and avoid rejection by removing disclosure from the equation. Ultimately, though, I think these networks work to affirm stigma, rather than reduce or dismantle it. These websites and applications typically eliminate disclosure upon admission by asking for users’ STI status and diagnosis. In these networks’ efforts to market a safe space, they define STI positive folks as an “other,” a community unworthy of love and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#affection&quot; title=&quot;A state or demonstration of fondness or care for someone, which may or may not be sexual.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;affection&lt;/a&gt; outside of their diagnosis. As much time as this population works to separate their identities from their STI, these dating applications reinforce and can even delay the connection with others, but more importantly, with the self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;You’re Worthy of Sexual Pleasure From Partners and Yourself&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Society often views sexuality through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#monogamous&quot; title=&quot;In the context of sex, people choosing to be with each other sexually exclusively; to only have one sexual partner at a time.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;monogamous&lt;/a&gt;, partnered lens, especially when STIs enter the conversation. While many appreciate and enjoy partnered sex, a partner is not necessary to achieving sexual satisfaction with (or without) an STI. What often remains absent from the conversation is the pleasure that can be found within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STI positive folks are constantly discredited, equated as punchlines, and marked as ‘damaged goods’ through media and social circles misrepresentation and miseducation. It’s not uncommon after a positive STI diagnosis to seek validation and sexual worth through another person when the stigma echoes and reinforces the opposite. No matter your relationship or STI status, STIs should be a point of conversation for all partners, but not a sole determinant of your pleasure or sexual worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redefining yourself as worthy might not come easily after your diagnosis. It will likely take time. It will take time to unlearn the origination of stigma. ( &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/bodies/this_is_about_genital_herpes&quot;&gt;This piece&lt;/a&gt; from Leah Berkenwald here on Scarleteen is one good place to start.) It will take time to muddle through your feelings, desires, and thoughts. It will take time to really center back with yourself. When it comes to this journey, the opportunity for pleasure will always be waiting when you’re open to its reception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sex Re-Education Isn’t Your Responsibility &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most school-based sex education curriculums in the United States only cover the surface of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexually_transmitted_infections&quot; title=&quot;STIs: illness, infection and/or disease which is often or can be transmitted through sexual or other intimate contact, like HIV, Chlamydia or Herpes. Some people call STIs STDs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexually transmitted infections&lt;/a&gt;. You know, the outdated, extreme photos of folks’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#genitals&quot; title=&quot;External sexual or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;genitals&lt;/a&gt; and the presenting symptoms associated with each STI. While instructors may review statistics and barrier methods that aid in STI prevention, they rarely prepare students for their chances of contracting an STI and how best to navigate conversations with their partners. Educators are often not bold enough to share that internal and external condoms are not enough. They often won’t say that 50% of the classroom will likely contract an STI before they turn 25, or that STIs are usually either curable and manageable, and nothing to fear. They won’t often cop to their reactions of panic and disgust as internalized constructions of shame and mechanisms of stigma. They often won’t say that the stigma around STIs is unnecessary, unhelpful and something worth discussion in comprehensive classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hours, days, and weeks I spent researching transmission rates, statistics, and testing around herpes served as what I label as the beginnings of my own sex re-education. After a positive diagnosis, it’s natural to want to know more than what the doctor or pamphlet says. It’s expected that you’ll experience some level of fear in the unknown and what it means for you, your partners, and even your future. Unfortunately, most current sex education systems fail to prepare students for these very real moments in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexually_active&quot; title=&quot;Someone who has had or is currently having some kind of genital sex with a partner or partners.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexually active&lt;/a&gt; lives. This leaves a handful of open-ended questions; some that have an answer, and others that remain settled upon acceptance in uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you work through your sex re-education and confront potential disclosures, you’ll wonder about just how much to share with your partners. Like our sexual response systems, it’s expected that you will likely know more about your STI than your partner, however, it is not your sole responsibility to assume all the labor as the sex re-educator to your partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In disclosures, whether in person or via text message, I find it helpful to provide partners with various resources through a simple equation: one organization resource, one article, and one media recommendation. For example, an organization resource like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ashasexualhealth.org/stdsstis/&quot;&gt;American Sexual Health Association (ASHA)&lt;/a&gt;, an article that displays a personal narrative or message you’d like to convey to your partner about &lt;a href=&quot;https://hellogiggles.com/love-sex/sex/queer-women-herpes/&quot;&gt;living with your STI&lt;/a&gt;, and a media resource, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcIl-hclrLI&quot;&gt;Ella Dawson’s TEDx Talk&lt;/a&gt;. LaChrista Greco also offers some extra input on disclosures and educating partners on Scarleteen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/relationships_sexual_health/when_where_and_why_telling_your_partner_you_have_an_sti&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s expected that your partner may have additional questions for you beyond your chosen resources, but presenting them with the opportunity to self-educate, and re-educate themselves, allows for a more personal application and reflection. This exchange of information and research ultimately leads to the development of the foundational support skills necessary for your partners to actually &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; a partner to you. Although your partner may not experience your STI or completely understand what it’s like to live with one, they learn your story and the emotions—the ups, downs, and in-betweens—that come along with your diagnosis. During the moments that you thought you’d always be alone, they offer you a hand, a hug, and a holding space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Love Letter to Ourselves &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I travel back to my diagnosis and the days, months, and now, years that followed, I recognize the opportunity that accompanied its arrival. Despite the initial shame, guilt, name calling, jokes, and fear related to disclosure, &lt;b&gt;my STI presented me with a chance to love myself more deeply&lt;/b&gt;. It gave me a chance to sit with myself, who I thought myself to be, who I thought I was going to become, and who I really was. It took me months to really look at myself in the mirror. To name my features, to not piece apart my body or what I felt its worth to be after my diagnosis. I sat somewhere between my positive herpes status and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#identity&quot; title=&quot;The defining character or personality of an individual; who we feel like we are as a person. Identity is often used to talk about sexual identity -- who we are as sexual people, which can include things like our sexual orientation, our preferences and things we like and want in sex and sexuality, our sexual politics -- or gender identity, who we feel we are and identify as (even if only to ourselves) in terms of our gender.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;identity&lt;/a&gt; negotiating the relationship between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere within that inner work, launched acceptance. An acceptance far greater than the questions without answers and the partners who may respond with rejection. An acceptance that sourced much deeper than the infection beneath my skin. An acceptance and welcoming of a self that had been waiting for freedom from more than a positive STI diagnosis. A self I waited over twenty-two years to release. That acceptance is waiting for &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Autism, Romance And How We See Other People</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/article/disability/autism_romance_and_how_we_see_other_people</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-author field-type-text field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Douglas Laman&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-introduction field-type-text-long field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;As a person on the Autism spectrum, I know all too well that living with any sort of disability brings about a barrage of challenges. Your own difficult experiences living with those challenges are important and you have a right to feel all kinds of emotions about them, including frustration at the larger world.

However, just as your own humanity and emotions should not be discounted, the same goes for other human beings. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;The notion of women being prizes for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#heterosexual&quot; title=&quot;Someone who is only or mostly emotionally and sexually attracted to people of a different sex or gender than they are themselves.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;heterosexual&lt;/a&gt; men is still a widespread concept today, building upon conventional societal ideas about women being objects that have existed for centuries. (Remember when you could trade livestock for a potential bride?) This philosophy serves as a bedrock for groups like incels and other communities all across the internet. It’s such a widely circulated concept that Scarleteen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/no_more&quot;&gt;has even published two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/politics_relationships_sexual_identity_sexuality_gender/man_to_man_on_sex_masculinity_and?language=en&quot;&gt;pieces in the past&lt;/a&gt; debunking it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I’m going to talk about a specific group of people that often succumbs to to this philosophy, whether consciously or unconsciously. Specifically, I’m talking about human beings with physical and/or mental disabilities who use their own personal challenges to justify feeling like the greater universe owes them the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#romantic&quot; title=&quot;Of, or relating to, intimate or passionate love or interest.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;romantic&lt;/a&gt; attraction of a woman as a sort of consolation prize. As a person on the Autism spectrum, I know all too well that living with any sort of disability brings about a barrage of challenges. Your own difficult experiences living with those challenges are important and you have a right to feel all kinds of emotions about them, including frustration at the larger world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, just as your own humanity and emotions should not be discounted, the same goes for other human beings. Just because you face your own set of specific challenges doesn’t mean you get a free pass to discount the humanity of someone else. Everybody’s got their own challenges to face on a day-to-day basis. That’s a notion I myself had to learn the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when I was in High School, like most teenagers, I was struggling in a number of respects. One of these respects was connected to how I had a warped mindset related to romance, fueled by a self-pitying attitude tied into my Autism. I saw pictures of happy couples on social media and it made me want to scream out in jealous frustration. How did they do it? How did they manage to create, let alone sustain, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#relationship&quot; title=&quot;Some kind of ongoing interaction or association with another person, place or thing.

There are all kinds of relationships: family relationships, friendships, romantic relationships, and sexual relationships. Sometimes there is an overlap where we have more than one kind of relationship with someone. Sometimes people use the word relationship to only mean a romantic, &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot;, or committed relationship, even though that&amp;#039;s not all this word means.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;relationship&lt;/a&gt;? I was like a kid watching David Copperfield pulling off an elaborate magic trick, while struggling myself to pull a rabbit out of a hat. My own personal feelings of self-worth were negatively impacted by my inability to get a date for the Homecoming dance or any other big social function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of combating those feelings by learning to determine my self-worth through other means, I decided to fix my own emotional turmoil by approaching women in a manner that saw them as props to be won rather than as people. I’d get infatuated with the idea of dating a certain woman without ever considering what was going on in her life or, most importantly, what she might want. My primary motivation for this approach was the idea that the universe somehow “owed me” a date because I had Autism. This belief justified my entire mindset and led to a number of awkward encounters where I’d just randomly spring elaborate Valentine’s Day gifts or proposals for dates on lady classmates who were blindsided by this sudden turn of events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why wouldn’t they be blindsided? Such feelings or attractions came out of nowhere like the twist ending of an M. Night Shyamalan movie. Plus, these grand romantic gestures were usually done in awkward public settings that put so much stressful pressure on the woman I was doing these gestures for. My choice to do these gestures in grand public spaces conducive to a photo op, but not to making room to understand the woman’s personal feelings, is another example of how I saw women I had taken a mild interest in as just objects to be won. I was too busy planning extravagant gifts to bother with little things like “How might the woman I’m giving this to feel about this?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, that’s a part of my life I managed to outgrow once I left high school. Entering college, my worldview expanded immensely, partially due to forces in my control and others out of my hands. In terms of things I could control, I began to attend classes on feminist literature, philosophy and other courses that made me re-evaluate how I treated others and what was really important in the world. In terms of things beyond my control, well, my first year of college intersected with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2014/10/23/7044593/gamergate&quot;&gt;the start of Gamergate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/15/opinion/what-is-gamergate.html&quot;&gt;a movement&lt;/a&gt; consisting of dudes viciously harassing women working in the video game industry as well as opposing the idea of diversity in video games in general. Sometimes it takes seeing the actions of others to realize what’s wrong inside yourself. Seeing the ugly entitlement that defined so much of the misogyny found in the participants of Gamergate echoed too much of my own high school mindset towards women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s through these events that I was able to grow as a person and truly recognize the fact that women are not objects to be coveted but just people on this planet. The universe doesn’t owe me anything, particularly when it comes to the wretched idea of delivering female romantic companions like a UPS driver delivers packages. Part of growing up is realizing how misguided parts of our youth were. For me, the process of growing up has made me come to terms with the fact that women don’t owe you anything, no matter what physical or mental disability you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, it’s worth noting how this mindset feeds into hurtful stereotypes of people on the Autism spectrum. The idea that people on the Autism spectrum can’t be accountable for their own behavior in regards to crossing boundaries with women or other people is an excuse often used by neurotypical people to excuse men’s bad behavior, while further stigmatizing Autistic people. I’m not saying that every single person on the Autism spectrum is in total control or knows exactly how to avoid every social faux pas in history. But most of us are capable of recognizing the humanity in other people and not treating them as objects. Using Autism as a source of martyrdom to justify how we treat women and other members of marginalized communities feeds into negative conceptions neurotypical people have for individuals on the Autism spectrum, and that’s just not good at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People on the Autism spectrum deserve better than being seen as inherently clueless and dangerous. We deserve to be seen as people in the eyes of general society. Everybody does. Autistic men should fight back against these stereotypes by doing something we should be doing anyway: taking the time to recognize women as people too. It can be painful to take the time to dig deep inside ourselves to recognize our own issues lie within. I can say that from experience. But it’s all worth it for learning how to recognize humanity both in yourself and in the human beings around you.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Impurity Culture: Pregnancy and Fear</title>

Here&amp;#039;s how you can counteract those beliefs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Linda Kay Klein’s book &lt;em&gt;Pure: Inside the Evangelical Movement that Shamed a Generation of Young Women and How I Broke Free&lt;/em&gt;, she tells a story about how she took a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#pregnancy_test&quot; title=&quot;What we tell you to take when you ask us if you&amp;#039;re pregnant. A test that can be done at home or by a healthcare provider to determine pregnancy. Usually a urine test, a pregnancy test measures for a specific hormone, hCG, only produced with pregnancy. &quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;pregnancy test&lt;/a&gt; at the doctor’s office even though she’d been taking &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#birth_control&quot; title=&quot;Any number of methods people use to intentionally prevent unwanted pregnancy, including the condom, the cervical barrier, the implant, the patch, the pill, the rhythm method, the ring, the shot, the IUD, spermicide and withdrawal.

The term &amp;quot;partner&amp;quot; can be used for all kinds of relationships, not just serious ones. &amp;quot;Partner&amp;quot; can also mean the person someone is with in a romantic or familial partnership.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;partner&lt;/a&gt;. When I read that, it brought to mind something even more paranoid I’d done in the past: I took a pregnancy test once when the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual&quot; title=&quot;About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; experience I’d had was giving a hand job. I don’t really know why I did it, other than that I’m pretty sure I was convinced that stepping outside the bounds of what I had been taught about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; was sure to have consequences. Surely, somehow, some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sperm&quot; title=&quot;Reproductive cells of people with penises which can fertilize an ovum and create pregnancy.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sperm&lt;/a&gt; must have traveled across space and time in exactly the right direction and gotten me pregnant—and that’s what I got for not waiting until marriage. That&#039;s what they said happened to girls like me. My anxiety was through the roof during that time, and it had absolutely no connection to biological, medical or spiritual reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it turns out that it’s not just me. I ran a quick Twitter poll while I was writing this article and found that out of 1,843 people with uteruses who responded, 497 had taken a pregnancy test in the past before they had ever had any kind of sex that can get a person with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#uterus&quot; title=&quot;In people assigned female at birth (unless it has been surgically removed or was not formed in utero), an internal, muscular reproductive organ in the pelvis. During pregnancy, this is where a fetus will develop. When not pregnant, it is the lining of the uterus, when shed each cycle, that provides a menstrual period.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;uterus&lt;/a&gt; pregnant. That’s hardly peer-reviewed science, but it also shows that I’m hardly alone. And it’s a really easy thing to feel shame about. On Twitter, several people reached out to me to tell me that they thought they were the only person in the world who had taken a pregnancy test when they couldn’t possibly be pregnant, and just knowing that other people had also had that experience immediately made them feel so much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this phenomenon doesn’t make sense medically, it makes a lot of sense psychologically. Purity culture pedals lots of myths and lies about pregnancy, from theological threats to biological inaccuracies. If you’re a person with a uterus and you grew up in purity culture, it’s totally normal to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/bodies/youre_not_pregnant_why_do_you_think_you_are&quot;&gt;anxiety about pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; that stems from some of those falsehoods—even to the point of taking a pregnancy test when someone else’s sperm hasn’t been anywhere near your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#vagina&quot; title=&quot;The internal passage leading from the opening of the vulva to the cervix of the uterus.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;vagina&lt;/a&gt;. I’m going to unpack a few of these myths and lies in this column, and hopefully leave everyone reading with an unshakeable sense that you are normal and loved and there is nothing wrong with you if you have ever been affected by purity culture in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. You Are Not The Virgin Mary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biblical account of Mary, the mother of Jesus, getting pregnant though a miracle of God even though she had never had sex is one of the most important and paradigmatic stories in Christianity. And there’s a lot of different ways to interpret it—not every Christian community takes the story literally, and there are interesting interpretive issues at play with both the Greek and Hebrew words that often get translated as “virgin” in the Bible. But for those whose communities do take the story literally, the idea that God could make you pregnant even if you didn’t have sex is pretty scary! From a theological standpoint, it’s fine to believe whatever you want about the veracity of the historical virgin birth of Jesus, or not believe in it at all. But it’s important to remember that no matter your theology, from a medical and biological perspective, getting pregnant solely through an act of God can’t happen to you—even if your anxiety is telling you otherwise. Truth is one of the most powerful tools we can use when our anxiety gets out of hand. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/etc/anxiety_lies&quot;&gt;Gentley confronting your anxiety with facts&lt;/a&gt; is the key to getting past this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons this is such a common fear actually has nothing to do with Mary at all. In the Bible, we learn that God chose Mary to be the mother of Jesus because of her virtue. But often when young people with uteruses who are growing up in purity culture internalize this fear of divine pregnancy, it’s for the exact opposite reason: they believe they have been bad, and deserve to be punished. It’s as though they’ve taken one part of the virgin story and mixed it with the shame that comes from purity culture to create this monster under the bed that threatens to eat you if you stick even one finger over the edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Pregnancy Is Not a Punishment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That confusion makes sense: when so much religious sexuality education can be boiled down to “don’t have sex or God will be angry and you’ll get pregnant,” it doesn’t take much time before those two threats get conflated. When pregnancy is even more commonly talked about as “consequence” of sex, it’s also easy to start thinking of it as punishment. Parents and teachers and conservative lawmakers alike have all derided feminist movements for promoting “sex without consequences,” and by “consequences&quot; they usually mean pregnancy, along with STIs. As someone who is both staunchly pro-choice and also hopes to be pregnant and have babies in the future, I think we can do better than calling pregnancy a “consequence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the Virgin Mary, many of us who grew up in purity culture spent months or years fearing that God knew we had transgressed the rules—if only just a little—and was going to punish us with a magical pregnancy as a result. But let’s be clear: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/bodies/where_did_i_come_from_a_refresher_course_in_human_reproduction&quot;&gt;Pregnancy occurs&lt;/a&gt; when a sperm and an egg meet and that fertilized egg then successfully implants on the wall of the uterus. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/patricia_h/2013/03/21/whos_afraid_of_sperm_cells&quot;&gt;Sperm doesn’t live long outside of a body&lt;/a&gt; or another protective environment (such as when it’s frozen for IVF procedures), and it can’t migrate from your hands or your mouth to your vagina unless you put it there. Stomach acid takes on much bigger projects than sperm cells every day. Pregnancy can only occur under very specific conditions—and it cannot occur merely because you had an experience that falls outside the norms of purity culture. I know it&#039;s easy to acknowledge this intellectually, but sometimes it&#039;s harder to really feel the truth of it in your mind and body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that does lead me to my next point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. It’s Actually Kind of Hard to Get Pregnant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way that some churches and abstinence-only “educators” talk about it, you’d think that you could get pregnant as easily as tripping down the stairs or forgetting your keys. By their telling, pregnancy is everywhere, and only if you follow their very narrow set of sexual ethics with extreme care will you avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ask anyone who’s been trying to get pregnant for a while without being able to, and you’ll find out that the story is actually a lot more complicated. Sometimes, even if a person with a uterus is having a kind of sex that can result in pregnancy, for various health reasons, they don’t ovulate in a given month. That means there’s not an egg there for the sperm to meet. If they do ovulate and have a kind of sex where sperm goes directly into the vagina, even that is not a guarantee of pregnancy. Lots of factors determine whether a sperm will meet an egg successfully, factors that medical science still does not completely understand. And even if an egg does become fertilized, it still has to implant on the uterine wall—which is the real challenge. Some estimates state that up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2005/05/implications-defining-when-woman-pregnant&quot;&gt;half of fertilized eggs don’t implant&lt;/a&gt; in the uterine wall and are reabsorbed by the body—low estimates are at about a third. But regardless, that’s a large percentage of fertilized eggs that never become pregnancies. Only if all of the factors are exactly right and the fertilized egg successfully implants do you become pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Birth Control Works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you grew up in purity culture, you probably heard all about birth control. Many churches, parents and educators teach that condoms don’t work, that birth control pills make you infertile, that IUDs “cause abortions,” and many other lies. Purity culture “graduates” would be completely justified in being afraid that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#condom&quot; title=&quot;A thin sheath or tube of latex or another material, worn over the penis during sex to prevent or reduce the risk of pregnancy and/or sexually transmitted infections.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;condom&lt;/a&gt; they just used didn’t work, because they’ve been told their whole lives that condoms regularly fail. But the facts don’t back this up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional condoms are about 98% effective with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#perfect_use&quot; title=&quot;When a birth control method is used correctly and reliably, the whole time, every time, in accordance with the manufacturer&amp;#039;s directions. Many birth control methods will state an effectiveness for &amp;quot;perfect use&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;typical use.&amp;quot; &quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;perfect use&lt;/a&gt;, and even if you don’t use them perfectly each time they’re still about 85% effective (remember, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#effectiveness&quot; title=&quot;How well something works.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;effectiveness&lt;/a&gt; rates a figured for a &lt;em&gt;year&lt;/em&gt; of using a method, which means that for any given instance of sex, a method can be 100% effective). If you’re using condoms in addition to another method, like birth control pills (which are 99% effective with perfect use), your protection goes up even more. Obviously we&#039;re humans, not robots: there are times when condoms break or someone forgets a pill. But by and large birth control is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/etc/have_a_little_faith_in_bc&quot;&gt;very effective way of preventing pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;. If you’ve ever had pregnancy anxiety stemming from the purity culture lie that birth control doesn’t work, you’re definitely not alone, and I would encourage you to do some research and empower yourself! It goes back to the facts. When you know the facts, then you can make the choices that are right for you out of a place of knowledge rather than fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purity culture can be kind of a head trip, and sometimes it’s hard to tell what’s real and what’s not. It can be easy for the traumatized mind to attach to a negative thought or idea and spiral downward along with it until you can no longer tell where the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#trauma&quot; title=&quot;A serious or critical physical and/or emotional injury or physically and/or emotionally painful experience.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;trauma&lt;/a&gt; ends and reality begins. And make no mistake about it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/qa/welcome_to_impurity_culture_emily_joy_and_hannah_boning_on_sex_and_relationships&quot;&gt;purity culture is a trauma&lt;/a&gt;—which is why I believe it’s so important to talk openly about these things and be gentle with ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you feel foolish for taking a pregnancy test when you haven’t had pregnancy-causing sex, or you feel ashamed of letting the lies and fear-mongering of purity culture get to you. Perhaps, deep down, you’re still not sure if you’re really on the right path after all, and you’re just waiting for the other shoe to drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if there’s one thing I’ve learned since leaving purity culture, it’s that living your life waiting for the other shoe to drop is a surefire way to create a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you believe bad things are going to happen to you, you will live as if bad things are going to happen to you and make decisions accordingly. You will shame-spiral and self-flagellate, and all of the mental energy that could have been used on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/abuse_assault/selfcare_a_la_carte&quot;&gt;caring for yourself&lt;/a&gt; and thinking critically about your situation gets spent on feeling sorry for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your time with this stuff. It’s hard to undo. Go at your own pace, and know that you’re not alone. And if you ever get caught up in the false messaging that was so formative for so many of us, go back to the facts. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/read/all_about_s_e_x_the_scarleteen_book&quot;&gt;Hit the books&lt;/a&gt;. That’s why a website like Scarleteen exists. That’s why I’m out here sharing about the time I took a pregnancy test when there was absolutely no way I could be pregnant. Because in community, we find our power.&lt;/p&gt;

People often have day-to-day coping mechanisms to help manage their spasticity, but what do you do when you have spasticity and want to have sex?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injuries, among other disabilities, can involve &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Symptoms-Diagnosis/MS-Symptoms/Spasticity&quot;&gt;spasticity&lt;/a&gt;. Your muscles might feel stiff and you might have to focus a lot of energy to move them. You might also experience spasms and pain as well. People often have day-to-day coping mechanisms to help manage their spasticity, but what do you do when you have spasticity and want to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are a few tips on dealing with sex and spasticity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main tip for anything sex and disability-related is to have good, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/disability/a_disabled_persons_guide_to_talking_with_your_partners_about_sex&quot;&gt;open communication&lt;/a&gt; with your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual&quot; title=&quot;About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; partners. You might worry that talking about your spasticity is not the sexiest thing to talk about, but you can make it fun, and it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/relationships/be_a_blabbermouth_the_whys_whats_and_hows_of_talking_about_sex_with_a_partner&quot;&gt;important to your pleasure&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to give your partner a textbook definition of spasticity or your disability. A good place to start is with how spasticity affects you. Where do you experience the most spasticity in your body? What can your partner do to help you feel relaxed? What positions do and don’t work for you? Allow your partner to ask questions and maybe touch and feel your body before you get sexual so they can become more familiar with how your body typically works and feels outside of sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another good way to manage spasticity during sex is to try and time your medication around when you are going to be having sex. For example, if you know you feel the most relaxed 2 hours after you take your medication, try to have sex around that time! There is a huge myth that all sex needs to be spontaneous, which is simply not true. Scheduled sex can be just as fun and sexy as spontaneous sex. Also, if you use an “as needed” type of medication for your spasticity, you can absolutely use it for sex! Feeling good during sex is just as important as feeling good on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having your partner give you a massage is not only a great way for you to relax, but it lets your partner feel exactly where you are the most spastic. They can keep that in mind for the rest of your fun time together. Massages are also very intimate and can be great &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#foreplay&quot; title=&quot;What some people call sexual activities that are not intercourse which they may do before intercourse or as a &amp;quot;warmup&amp;quot; to intercourse, such as kissing, manual sex or oral sex. However, all kinds of &amp;quot;foreplay&amp;quot; can also be or are kinds of sex, and may sometimes be the only sex people choose to or can engage in at a given time, or altogether.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;foreplay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movies and TV shows often portray sex like this 5-minute activity where you race to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#orgasm&quot; title=&quot;An event typically in response to physical or intellectual sexual stimulation, controlled by the involuntary nervous system. Orgasm often results in muscle contractions in and around the genitals, other muscular spasms throughout the body, and a feeling of sexual and/or tension release.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;orgasm&lt;/a&gt;. In real life, sex can be slow and relaxed if you want it to be. You and your partner(s) get to set the pace. For example, if you need a few minutes for your body to relax, that&#039;s totally fine. Or if you need to take a break during sex or stop completely, that is also okay. Just tell your partner how you feeling, whether it&#039;s good, bad, or if something needs to change. Any good partner is going to be open to whatever pace and style you might need to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, too, that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/advice/whats_sex&quot;&gt;sex can happen many different ways&lt;/a&gt;. For example, if you are having a high spasticity day, you can just lay next to your partner and instruct them on how to get themself or you off. You can pick the toy and speed, and tell them how to maneuver it. You can still be super involved in the sex, without having to be as physically involved. Also, texting exactly what you want your partner to do before they arrive is not only sexy but it lets them know how you are feeling that day and what you are able/interested in doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a ton of fun toys and props that can help you be more comfortable during sex. Wedges and pillows can help get you in the most comfortable possible positions so that your body can relax. Toys like vibrators and dildos (and so much more) can help you reduce the physical labor of sex. Also, when you think about what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/sexuality/left_foot_red_right_hand_green_the_deal_on_sex_positions&quot;&gt;positions would work for you&lt;/a&gt;, don’t limit yourself to just the typical sex positions. Think about what positions, in general, your body naturally feels most comfortable in. You can make almost any position work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And don’t just focus on the negatives: your spasticity can actually benefit you! It can make holding certain positions easier. For folks with vulvas and vaginas, if your spasticity affects your PC muscles, it can make having multiple orgasms a lot easier. So use your spasticity to your advantage as much as you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the lack of good information about spasticity and sex, you might think it is not possible to have a sex life if you experience spasticity. However, with good communication and a little creativity, you can definitely have good and fulfilling sex life, whatever that means to you!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>How to Approach Sexual Fantasy and Desire on Your Own Terms</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/article/abuse_and_assault_bodies_sexuality/how_to_approach_sexual_fantasy_and_desire_on_your_own</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-author field-type-text field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Cass Ball&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-introduction field-type-text-long field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Fantasy is an important part of our relationships with ourselves and our sexual desires. But it can also be a source of shame. How can we find ways to reconnect with our sexual fantasies and create a healthy relationship with desire. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fantasy is an important part of our relationships with ourselves and our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual&quot; title=&quot;About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; desires. We are all born with imaginative minds — as children, we find it natural to want, to fantasize. At one point, we were all experts in our own desires. It was easy for us to recognize pleasure and imagine how we could repeat that pleasure, expand it, prolong it, refine it. It was easy for us to imagine a life beyond what we know. Over the course of our lives, other people have rejected and belittled us for our desires, and we began to feel shame and quiet ourselves. No one is born feeling shame, but no one passes through life without internalizing it. We learn, through media, our families, and politics, that certain types of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; and relationships are acceptable and other types are regarded with disdain and are punished. Shame can make us believe that our desires are inherently bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many people, an important part of personal healing involves reclaiming one’s access to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#desire&quot; title=&quot;A feeling of strongly wanting something. In the context of sex, desire can be a strong feeling of a physical and psychological want for any kind of sex.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;desire&lt;/a&gt; and fantasy. adrienne maree brown, who is an organizer, writer, and doula, combines her thoughts about pleasure, desire, shame, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#social_justice&quot; title=&quot;An equitable distribution of advantages, assets, and benefits among all members of a society.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;social justice&lt;/a&gt; into the term &lt;em&gt;pleasure activism. &lt;/em&gt;In her book, also titled &lt;em&gt;Pleasure Activism&lt;/em&gt;, she defines the term as, “the work we do to reclaim our whole, happy, and satisfiable selves from the impacts, delusions, and limitations of oppression and/or supremacy” (13).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecting to sexual fantasies is a way to rekindle a healthy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#relationship&quot; title=&quot;Some kind of ongoing interaction or association with another person, place or thing.

There are all kinds of relationships: family relationships, friendships, romantic relationships, and sexual relationships. Sometimes there is an overlap where we have more than one kind of relationship with someone. Sometimes people use the word relationship to only mean a romantic, &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot;, or committed relationship, even though that&amp;#039;s not all this word means.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;relationship&lt;/a&gt; with desire. There are many benefits to practicing fantasy. Engaging in fantasy, even when you don’t act on it, can help you break through shame, or transcend boredom. Sharing your fantasies with your sexual partners can be an opportunity to be vulnerable and connect with your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#partner&quot; title=&quot;In a sexual context, a person with whom someone is having some kind of sex. The term &amp;quot;partner&amp;quot; can be used for all kinds of relationships, not just serious ones. &amp;quot;Partner&amp;quot; can also mean the person someone is with in a romantic or familial partnership.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;partner&lt;/a&gt; on a deeper level. Fantasy is an opportunity for fun. For excitement. If you tend to be anxious when approaching sex and relationships, fantasy is an opportunity to ask, “What if everything goes right?” Fantasy can even be a part of the healing process for people who have experienced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#trauma&quot; title=&quot;A serious or critical physical and/or emotional injury or physically and/or emotionally painful experience.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;trauma&lt;/a&gt;: being able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/relationships/be_a_blabbermouth_the_whys_whats_and_hows_of_talking_about_sex_with_a_partner&quot;&gt;negotiate strict boundaries&lt;/a&gt; and have your partner &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/abuse_assault/drivers_ed_for_the_sexual_superhighway_navigating_consent&quot;&gt;prioritize your consent&lt;/a&gt; can be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/nee9yg/bsdm-can-provide-profound-healing-experiences&quot;&gt;transformative experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though fantasy is often associated with kink, it doesn’t have to be. Fantasy is just any imaginary scenario that brings you pleasure to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fantasy in Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be helpful to rely on other people’s fantasies to inspire your own, which is why many people use audiovisual media, like TV, movies, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#pornography&quot; title=&quot;Written, visual or other kinds of media either expressly designed to elicit feelings of sexual desire and/or which people use to elicit those feelings.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;pornography&lt;/a&gt;, for inspiration. But it is important to analyze the context of this media. What types of relationships does it depict? Does it depict harmful stereotypes? What feels healthy about the depiction of fantasy? Another consideration for consuming audiovisual media is that the fantasies that this type of media provides are only visual and auditory, while real-life sex is multisensory, thus limiting our imagination when it comes to all of the amazing ways that we can have sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The depiction of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual_fantasy&quot; title=&quot;An idea, thought or pattern of thoughts and/or ideas that creates or enhances sexual feelings.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual fantasy&lt;/a&gt; in media provides scripts for fantasies that don’t always align with our values and can sometimes be emotionally and physically violent. In &lt;em&gt;Pleasure Activism&lt;/em&gt;, adrienne maree brown writes, “If we aren’t both careful and creative we can get stuck in fantasies that don’t mature and politicize with us. We can get caught in fantasies that perpetuate things so counter to our beliefs and values that we feel ashamed of what we want, even as we find ways to get it” (222).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick Google search of “sexual fantasy” yields a bunch of articles about which fantasies are the most common. At first glance, articles like these seem to make an attempt to bring fantasy into the mainstream, perhaps believing that once people become comfortable with these “more normal” fantasies, acceptance will trickle down to the fantasies that are considered more deviant. Trickle-down social justice doesn’t work, though. If we take marriage equality as an example, we were told that trans rights would come next, but marriage equality did not trickle down to employment security, protection against violence, and improved healthcare for trans people. The fight for marriage equality did not interrogate the larger structural issues of capitalism, healthcare, and the privileges that couples experience over people who are single or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#polyamorous&quot; title=&quot;People choosing to have more than one sexual or romantic partner at a time. Polyamory usually implies that this is wanted by all parties, negotiated and agreed upon. Polyamory is not &amp;quot;cheating,&amp;quot; unless someone breaks the agreements they have made in polyamorous relationships.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;polyamorous&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, the discourse around normalizing just a few sexual fantasies does not interrogate the larger cultural scripts in our society that tell us that certain fantasies are too deviant, too &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#queer&quot; title=&quot;In the context of sexuality, a broad term for sexual orientation that can describe any number of orientations which are not heterosexual. People who identify as queer may be bisexual or pansexual, gay or lesbian, questioning, asexual or more. &quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;queer&lt;/a&gt;, too &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#kinky&quot; title=&quot;Describes sexual practices or activities which a person or group of people considers to be outside &amp;quot;the norm&amp;quot;, or describes a person who enjoys and/or pursues those practices.

&lt;p&gt;Other search results include advice articles about how to “spice up your sex life.” Here, too, these types of articles usually assume a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#heterosexual&quot; title=&quot;Someone who is only or mostly emotionally and sexually attracted to people of a different sex or gender than they are themselves.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;heterosexual&lt;/a&gt;, cis, abled couple who typically has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#vaginal_intercourse&quot; title=&quot;When a penis or sex toy is inserted into and held by the vagina while partners move their bodies as feels good to them for the purpose of either sexual stimulation and/or reproduction.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;vaginal intercourse&lt;/a&gt;. Many of these articles suggest that you should coerce your partner into “naughtier” play through a lack of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#communication&quot; title=&quot;Various ways we express and share feelings or thoughts, such as through speech, written words or symbols, sign language, body language, touch or art.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;communication&lt;/a&gt;, surprising your partner, and engaging in submission and dominance without their consent. It is never okay to surprise your partner with unexpected touch, hoping to gain some control over them or to play mind-games. Engaging in fantasy and changing aspects of your sexual relationship always requires active, compassionate communication, and an understanding that your partner might not want to engage in the same fantasies that you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of mainstream TV and film depicts a “love-at-first-sight” approach to love, where characters merely lock eyes and “know.” These narratives portray love as something that just clicks. They also often portray a man projecting his desires and expectations onto a woman and never asking her what she wants. In these forms of media, the characters don’t have to talk about consent or boundaries or desires. When they have sex, their clothes just effortlessly slide off. Their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#romantic&quot; title=&quot;Of, or relating to, intimate or passionate love or interest.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;romantic&lt;/a&gt; and sexual interactions are effortless and often wordless. Of course it’s possible to feel attraction when seeing someone for the first time, but building a relationship and developing love requires consistent communication, vulnerability, and compromise. Communicating your desires with words can feel awkward, especially if you’re new to it, but with the right partner you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/relationships/dating_and_sex_in_my_20s&quot;&gt;laugh through the awkwardness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/advice/how_and_why_to_root_for_team_awkward&quot;&gt;use it as a way to connect&lt;/a&gt;. Connecting to your fantasies can help you communicate with partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another form of media that many people take their fantasies from is porn. Watching porn can be a great way to explore your sexual interests from the comfort of home. Some porn companies upload behind-the-scenes interviews with the performers, sometimes showing the performers giving consent before the scene and their reactions afterwards. These interviews can provide useful scripts for how to negotiate a scene and get consent. However, most of these clips don’t make it to the tube sites where it’s easy to find illegally-downloaded porn. One of the issues with tube sites is that they are free to access, and the most direct way to ensure that porn is being ethically produced is to&lt;a href=&quot;https://jizlee.com/ethical-porn-consumption-pay-for-porn-anti-piracy/&quot;&gt; pay for it&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, this means that young people often cannot access the more radical types of porn that are inclusive and emphasize consent, which are often behind a paywall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a young person who cannot access porn that is behind a paywall, you can view porn with a critical eye until you are financially independent. Here are some things to consider when watching porn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the video show the performers giving consent? Also note that it’s possible that consent is being given behind-the-scenes. Do some research on the production company. Can you find a performer consent policy? Consent in porn is multifaceted: it involves the performers agreeing to specific sex acts in advance of filming, professional conditions on set, and fair pay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get to know the performers on social media. Kayla Jane Danger, who owns her own porn company and directs performers, says, &quot;If the performers are supporting and tweeting about scenes they were in, you should feel comfortable that they are ethical. They&#039;re sharing it because they&#039;re generally proud of the work they have done and they&#039;re happy with the product that comes out of it.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask yourself if you feel represented by the performers and how their identities are depicted. Do you feel represented by the race/&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender&quot; title=&quot;Characteristics that are seen or presented as distinguishing between male and female in a society. Gender may or may not include assigned or chosen: social roles, feelings, behaviors and/or presentation or appearance.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt;/sexuality/ability of the performers? How does the porn title and description make you feel? Porn can sometimes perpetuate harmful stereotypes.Does the porn you’re watching feel inclusive of different types of bodies or does it normalize only a few?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considerations and Prompts for Connecting to Sexual Fantasy in a Healthy Way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing how media often depicts harmful sexual fantasies is a great way to start thinking about fantasy, and it is important work to become unbound from these societal scripts. Moving forward without a script, however, is really hard work. If you decide to explore your fantasies without a script, know that you are courageous for being on this journey! So many people stick to these scripts so that they don’t have to do the hard work of connecting with their own desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a perfect relationship with fantasy. As a queer trans woman, I have often felt a disconnect between myself and my desires, and I am on a personal journey to reclaim my access to genuine desire. I am not an expert advising you at the end of my journey with all-knowing wisdom. Rather, I am in the middle of my healing journey alongside you. But I can share some prompts and considerations that have helped me, and may also help you to spark a connection with fantasies of your own.. The goal of these prompts is to create a flowing relationship with fantasy that is specific to you. Don’t worry about what you think you’re supposed to feel and try not to judge your fantasies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Notice What Feels Good&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be overwhelming to imagine a fantasy out of nowhere. A good place to start can be practicing mindfulness and noticing what feels good in your day-to-day life. Once you practice being present, it’s not that everything you notice will be sexual, but you will have honed the skills that will allow you to recognize sexual excitement in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meditation and/or yoga are both great options for practicing mindfulness. Meditation can be an opportunity to keep your body still while practicing breathwork and being present with what comes up in the mind. Yoga combines breathwork, meditation, and movement. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.headspace.com/&quot;&gt;Headspace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.calm.com/&quot;&gt;Calm&lt;/a&gt; are two popular meditation apps. Some popular free yoga resources are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene&quot;&gt;Yoga With Adriene&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.doyogawithme.com/&quot;&gt;DoYogaWithMe.com.&lt;/a&gt; Generally, YouTube is a treasure trove of meditative and yoga practices and guides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to meditation and yoga, daily reflection can go a long way. You might consider writing a list of things that excited you each day. From there, you might notice patterns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What excites you consistently?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there anything that has excited you that has surprised you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there anything that you thought would excite you but actually didn’t?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does it feel to keep track of desire and excitement?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Make a Playlist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since sex is multisensory, it can be useful to approach sexual fantasy through the senses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider making a sexy playlist. The playlist can be for masturbating, sex with partners, or whatever you want it to be. You don’t have to just choose songs that are overtly associated with sex or that you know other people find sexy, and the lyrics don’t have to be of a sexual nature. You can choose anything! Choose what excites you. The songs don’t have to have lyrics, belong to a specific genre, etc. After you’ve compiled your list of songs, try rearranging them to create a narrative. What can the following aspects of the music tell you about your desires?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tempo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intensity/Gentleness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Color&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instrumentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lyrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider journaling about the songs that you’ve chosen. What do you find sexy about these songs? Is there anything you’ve discovered about yourself that you might want to integrate into how you approach sex and desire?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Masturbate With Your Eyes Closed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/bodies_sexuality/going_solo_the_basics_of_masturbation&quot;&gt;When you masturbate&lt;/a&gt;, try closing your eyes! See what comes to mind. Consider putting on the sexy playlist in the background. If you want to, and you have access, you could even watch some porn, or a scene that excites you from a TV show or movie, before you begin to touch yourself, close the video, and then use your imagination to finish the scene while you masturbate. What do you imagine happening? Are you thinking about an experience you’ve already had that you’d like to repeat? Is it something that you’ve never done before? How do your fantasies compare to your lived experiences?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Engage Yourself in Dirty Talk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language can be incredibly sexy and is a fundamental part of sex. During sex, we can use language to communicate pleasure, ask for what we want, ask our partners what they want, instruct our partners, express a need to pause or stop, communicate boundaries, negotiate a scene, express dominance/submission, roleplay, etc. If you have privacy when you masturbate, try verbalizing your desires out loud. If you don’t have privacy, see if you can notice if there are things you would like to say. You can imagine talking from your own perspective, reacting to the sensation you’re feeling. You can also imagine talking from the perspective of a partner who is having sex with you. What do you want to verbalize? What is the tone of your voice? How would you want someone to talk to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does where you normally have sex or masturbate set you up to feel aroused and excited? Are there elements of your space that distract you? Do you have any fantasies about a sexual environment, even if it’s not a real possibility?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel compelled to deepen your relationship with fantasy, it can be useful to try any of these prompts. You might want to try a prompt once or you might want to revisit the same prompts every once in awhile to see how your fantasies shift over time. Remember that none of these prompts are mandatory and you are also free to explore fantasy at your own pace and within your own parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closing Considerations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any partners, you might choose to tell them about your fantasies. Remember that no one is required to act on these fantasies with you and that you should approach the conversation as an act of vulnerable sharing. If your partner decides to join you in incorporating a fantasy into sex, exactly how that happens is a negotiation between the two of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may notice that all of these prompts involve some amount of self-reflection. While your fantasies might involve other people, ultimately your relationship with fantasy mostly has to do with your relationship with yourself. You don’t have to act on all or any of your fantasies, especially if acting on a fantasy might have negative repercussions. And you are allowed to have fantasies that you know you shouldn’t act on. There’s nothing wrong with you if you fantasize about things you would never want to do in real life. Fantasies can be a safe way to explore your fears and the parts of yourself that you have unconsciously repressed. Of course, if your fantasy is something you want to act on and you feel safe doing so, it can be extremely rewarding to pursue your fantasies. Overall, it is healthy to kindle your relationship with desire. These fantasies are for you, whether or not you share them with anyone or act on them. Your fantasies can also change over time. Just having access to them can strengthen your relationships with others, bring you a ton of excitement, and help you connect to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Ethical Horniness, Or How To Find A Partner In An Enthusiastic Consent World</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/article/relationships/ethical_horniness</link>

Forever we’ve seen high profile men – almost always men – chasing people for sex, abusively. For the last few years, some high-profile men have been held at least a little accountable for it, which means it is not always swept under the rug anymore. But now that the abuse is more visible, if you stare into that abyss long enough, it might start to stare back at you. You could end up lying on your bed wondering if being a guy while being horny is somehow inherently tainted and gross. Most of us want to find someone or a few someones, for relationships or hookups, but right now, looking at some of that foulness, it might feel like trying to find a partner is a minefield of red flags because men’s sexuality is inextricably abusive.

The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt;. Forever we’ve seen high profile men – almost always men – chasing people for sex, abusively.

But now that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#abuse&quot; title=&quot;Purposeful harm or mistreatment of another person, which can be verbal, emotional, physical or sexual. An ongoing pattern or cycle of such mistreatment or harm can characterize an abusive relationship.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;abuse&lt;/a&gt; is more visible, if you stare into that abyss long enough, it might start to stare back at you. You could end up lying on your bed wondering if being a guy while being horny is somehow inherently tainted and gross. Most of us want to find someone or a few someones, for relationships or hookups, but right now, looking at some of that foulness, it might feel like trying to find a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#partner&quot; title=&quot;In a sexual context, a person with whom someone is having some kind of sex. The term &amp;quot;partner&amp;quot; can be used for all kinds of relationships, not just serious ones. &amp;quot;Partner&amp;quot; can also mean the person someone is with in a romantic or familial partnership.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;partner&lt;/a&gt; is a minefield of red flags because men’s sexuality is inextricably abusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sex Is Not Win-Lose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One big problem in the culture is that we have a bunch of beliefs floating around that sex is some kind of zero-sum game where one person is “giving it up” and the other “gets some.” &lt;div class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;quotecontent&quot;&gt;I called this the “commodity model” in the 2008 book Yes Means Yes: Visions of Female Sexual Power and A World Without Rape.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;If one person is getting something and one person is losing something, then it’s hard not view it as somebody taking advantage of someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, that’s regressive bunch of sexist propaganda! Lots of people want sex, lots of people like sex, and healthy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual&quot; title=&quot;About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; encounters aren’t a loss for anyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common argument I hear for the idea that sex is a thing where someone “gets some” and someone “gives it up,” is that women are much less interested in casual sex than men, and on really casual observation, that can look true. But when we look at it from the standpoint of risk and reward, it’s pretty clear that it’s more about mismatches in upsides and downsides than about differences in baseline &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#desire&quot; title=&quot;A feeling of strongly wanting something. In the context of sex, desire can be a strong feeling of a physical and psychological want for any kind of sex.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;desire&lt;/a&gt;. There’s an old, classic study that folks use to argue that women don’t like casual sex, where researchers just propositioned random strangers for sex, on the street, out of the blue. As you might guess, not a lot of women were up for that. But in recent years, psychologist &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecut.com/2014/02/woman-with-an-alternative-theory-of-hookups.html&quot;&gt;Terri Conley &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; at the University of Michigan has revisited that, and found that if the researchers control for a couple of basic factors, the differences disappear. Those differences are that (1) many men get off better and more reliably in casual sex with a new partner, whereas, for women, to get off well they may need to break a partner in a bit; and (2) there are safety and social risks for women that most men don’t face. Or, as Conley puts it, “The reason women are turning you down for casual sex seems to be that, for one thing, a lot of you are calling them sluts afterward. A lot of you aren’t bothering to try to be good in bed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;(Almost) Everybody Wants Some&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most folks have a sex drive: most men, most women, and most nonbinary people. Most of us want to get naked and touch sensitive bits with someone. Wanting to do that is not gross and it isn’t taking advantage of anyone. And actually doing it doesn’t have to be gross or abusive either. It starts with really basic ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone involved is a complete, co-equal person, a human being entitled to respect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What we do sexually should always be mutual. It’s only fun if it’s fun for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/abuse_assault/drivers_ed_for_the_sexual_superhighway_navigating_consent&quot;&gt;Consent&lt;/a&gt; isn’t a check-box. It’s a happy place, and sex is only fun if everyone is in the happy place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consent isn’t a checkbox. Every app or site we use asks us to check a thing that says we agree to a bunch of stuff we’ve never read, and we only do that because we know that we can’t change any of it and we basically don’t have a choice. Consent – enthusiastic consent, affirmative consent, meaningful consent; that is, real consent – is basically the opposite of that. Consent is the state of being into what is happening, being good with what is happening, and wanting it to continue to happen. It’s not something you flip on or off, at the start or at the end. It’s a state you need to make sure your partner is experiencing the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of our pop culture deals with sex like it’s all between men and women, and like men and women are different species. So this might read like a stereotypical list of things men owe women. But it isn’t. If you change the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender&quot; title=&quot;Characteristics that are seen or presented as distinguishing between male and female in a society. Gender may or may not include assigned or chosen: social roles, feelings, behaviors and/or presentation or appearance.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt; pairing, it&#039;s all still true. These are rules that go for all of us. A guy in a sexual situation (with anyone of any gender) has a complete right to be respected, and a right to consent – or not to! Guys can have boundaries, can say wait, or stop, or I’m not ready, or I don’t like that. And guys deserve partners who pay attention to whether or not they’re consenting the whole time, too. The “give it up/get some” way of thinking doesn’t really create space for that, which is another reason it’s busted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These ideas – co-equal people, everything mutual, continuous consent -- are basic components of human dignity. Sex can be an important part of the human experience. When we’re doing it, we’re all entitled to expect human dignity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Find A Partner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if wanting sex if okay, and having sex is okay, how do you go from the wanting it to the having it? The key word is “partner.” If you think about the people you have sex with as your partners, you’ll do right by them and yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also basically about human dignity. Connect what Dr. Conley said (the problem of guys not being very good at pleasing women and calling women sluts) with the bit about everybody being entitled to human dignity, and you get the old-fashioned “golden rule”: do unto others as you would have them do unto you. (Or any of the several &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule&quot;&gt;other versions&lt;/a&gt; that are around, because this piece of basic insight has popped up independently in more cultures than I can count.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your partner, or your potential partner, is a complete human being. They’ve got their own preferences and their own worries and their own stuff going on. So treat them as a potential partner in a mutual activity. There’s stuff you want to do. Preferably with them. So propose that (whether “that” is dating or a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#relationship&quot; title=&quot;Some kind of ongoing interaction or association with another person, place or thing.

There are all kinds of relationships: family relationships, friendships, romantic relationships, and sexual relationships. Sometimes there is an overlap where we have more than one kind of relationship with someone. Sometimes people use the word relationship to only mean a romantic, &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot;, or committed relationship, even though that&amp;#039;s not all this word means.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;relationship&lt;/a&gt;, or just hooking up), in a way that makes it an attractive prospect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How To Be Good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Conley outlined two problems. One is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#slut&quot; title=&quot;Usually a slur that judges women (and sometimes others) by their known or assumed sexual history, or puts it in question in order to harass her.  Sometimes, people will refer to themselves as sluts to try and reclaim the word and give it a positive meaning.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;slut&lt;/a&gt;-shaming. The other is the not being very good. It might seem like the way to fix this is to learn “all the stuff,” the tips-and-tricks kind of stuff about what to do with which finger or erogenous zone, the nibble-the-ear, lick-the-alphabet kind of stuff. But in fact, what most folks need to do is unlearn. Bruce Lee used to say, “the usefulness of a cup is its emptiness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of what you “learn” is wrong. Some of it is right, and really useful. The stuff about reducing risks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#infection&quot; title=&quot;When harmful microbes, or germs, or harmful levels of microbes/germs, enter the body and multiply, causing illness. The common cold, flu viruses, sexually transmitted infections, chickenpox, impetigo, rabies and diphtheria are some kinds of infections.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;infection&lt;/a&gt; and unwanted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#pregnancy&quot; title=&quot;The state of carrying a developing embryo or fetus within the uterus. Medically, someone is considered to be pregnant when an egg has been fertilized by sperm, cells divide, and the fertilized egg is implanted within the lining of the uterus.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;, the stuff about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#anatomy&quot; title=&quot;The body, parts of the body, or physical structure of organisms like people, animals or plants.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;anatomy&lt;/a&gt;, the stuff about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#communication&quot; title=&quot;Various ways we express and share feelings or thoughts, such as through speech, written words or symbols, sign language, body language, touch or art.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;communication&lt;/a&gt; and consent. All of that is good and helpful. But when it comes to how to make your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual_partner&quot; title=&quot;Someone besides yourself you have intentionally, actively and physically explored your sexual feelings with in some way, like via sexual activity such as intercourse, oral sex or manual sex.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual partner&lt;/a&gt; feel good, most of the stuff that people other than your partner will tell you actually holds you back Porn can’t tell you, movies can’t tell you, social media can’t tell you and your friends can’t tell you, because they don’t know your partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So try this: forget everything about how sex is supposed to go, and everything about how it’s supposed to look. Focus instead on how it’s supposed to feel, and what it’s supposed to do. Remember that everything about sex is about the people. Whether there is one or two or more people involved, every one of them is a partner, and every one needs to be happy with how it goes. To do that, they have to share information. Encourage each other to say what feels good (physically and emotionally), and do it more. Whatever doesn’t work — either for you or for them (physically or emotionally), stop doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it. Really. Some folks might tell you, for example, that “everyone” loves &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#oral_sex&quot; title=&quot;Use of the mouth, lips or tongue for sexual stimulation. Cunnilingus (&amp;quot;going down on&amp;quot;), fellatio (&amp;quot;blowjobs&amp;quot;) and analingus (&amp;quot;rimming&amp;quot;) are some common kinds of oral sex.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;oral sex&lt;/a&gt;. But not really. If you and your partner are not so into it, then it doesn’t do you any good. People might tell you that sex only “counts” or goes “all the way” if a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#penis&quot; title=&quot;One of the two external reproductive organs of people assigned male at birth.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;penis&lt;/a&gt; goes in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#vagina&quot; title=&quot;The internal passage leading from the opening of the vulva to the cervix of the uterus.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;vagina&lt;/a&gt;, or in some other entrance or whatever arbitrary definition “they” agree on. What good does that kind of keeping score do anybody? That stuff is for gossip, it doesn’t help anyone have better sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your partner may have a head start on how their body works from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#masturbation&quot; title=&quot;Ways that people seek out and/or experience sexual pleasure by themselves, without a sexual partner.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;masturbation&lt;/a&gt;. They might, say, already know the kind of touches that get them to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#orgasm&quot; title=&quot;An event typically in response to physical or intellectual sexual stimulation, controlled by the involuntary nervous system. Orgasm often results in muscle contractions in and around the genitals, other muscular spasms throughout the body, and a feeling of sexual and/or tension release.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;orgasm&lt;/a&gt; and the ones that feel good but won’t get them over the edge. If so, you can learn a lot if you are safe and not-judgy so they can tell you. Or, your partner may not have that experience, and you’ll both be figuring it out together, which can be it’s own kind of great. But the only way to know if it’s great, is to talk about it. The things you like, say you like, and do more. The things you don’t like, don’t do more of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, you need to communicate. That’s true for finding a partner, and for having good sex with one. Being a good partner isn’t standing against the wall hoping somebody will notice you, and it isn’t lying still for whatever your partner does, hoping they figure out what you like. Nothing is sexier that the person you want, telling you they want you. And nothing will get you to better sex faster than saying, “here, can I show you what I like?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Literally, you and your partner are the world’s only two experts on how you and your partner should have sex together. It’s a very specialized field. Nobody else knows more than the two of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Be The Partner You Wish To See In The World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you work really hard to be your best self, your genuine self, your confident self, your interesting self, and your crush still isn’t into you? What if you learn to be the kind of sex partner who listens and learns and works with your partner, and you still can&#039;t be with the person you want to be with? Your crush might be with someone else, or crushing on someone else, or oriented towards genders that are not yours, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#asexual&quot; title=&quot;In the context of human sexuality, someone who either does not experience or has not yet experienced any sexual desires at all, or who has experienced/does experience sexual desires, but not a desire to enact them with other individuals.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;asexual&lt;/a&gt;, or taking a vow of chastity … literally any reason at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where pop culture really steers us wrong. Movies and television are full of stories where refusing to take “no” for an answer works out great, and that’s not real life. The darker corners of the culture are now full of dudes sitting around furious that the woman they like doesn’t like them. They think the girlfriend of their dreams should just show up and fall into their lap. And with that attitude, with the resentment and desperation, who exactly are they appealing partners for, except other people who are already mad at the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fighters say, “either you win, or you learn.” When we don’t get what we want, it hurts. The partner we want will not always want us back, and not everything we want to do will work with the partners we have. We can’t make somebody else want anything. There are no cheat codes for people. We can make space to be sad when things don’t go our way. Being sad about that isn’t the same thing as being mad. But if you handle that with grace and dignity and respect, you can be proud of how you dealt with it, and keep moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So nobody owes it to you to love you or to have sex with you. And nobody can honestly tell you that you’ll get to be with a particular person – or any person – no matter what you do. But think about the things you do to find a partner and to be a good partner: treat people with dignity and respect, listen to their needs and boundaries, be flexible and prepared to meet people where they are. Those are life skills that nobody has ever been sorry to develop. You can’t go wrong by being a better person.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>A Guide to Accessing Abortion Care – Even When It Looks Hard </title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/article/pregnancy_and_parenting/a_guide_to_accessing_abortion_care</link>

And let’s say that after considering your options – carrying the pregnancy to term and becoming a parent, adoption, or abortion – you’ve decided that the best choice for you is to terminate your pregnancy. That’s fine! Depending on where you live, though, accessing abortion care could be an issue. This guide is here to help you figure out how to access the care you need.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s say one day you find out you’re pregnant. And let’s say that after considering your options – carrying the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#pregnancy&quot; title=&quot;The state of carrying a developing embryo or fetus within the uterus. Medically, someone is considered to be pregnant when an egg has been fertilized by sperm, cells divide, and the fertilized egg is implanted within the lining of the uterus.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; to term and becoming a parent, adoption, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#abortion&quot; title=&quot;A procedure to intentionally end a pregnancy before a birth. Miscarriage is also sometimes called &amp;quot;spontaneous abortion,&amp;quot; even though it is usually not intended.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt; – you’ve decided that the best choice for you is to terminate your pregnancy. That’s fine! Depending on where you live, though, accessing abortion care could be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barriers to access to abortion take many shapes. You might face geographic barriers, meaning that you live in a place where terminating your pregnancy is illegal or severely restricted – or that, despite the law, the objection of doctors or the lack of clinics makes it impossible for you to get an abortion there. There could be time-related barriers: in many cases, national laws establish a number of weeks after which doctors can’t perform abortions. In others, underage people who are pregnant must obtain their parents’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#consent&quot; title=&quot;To agree to do something or give permission. In the context of sex, a person is giving full consent/is consenting when they freely and actively agree to do something sexual with someone else; however, the person still has the right to change their mind at any point. A person is NOT consenting if they do not actively agree, have been forced or pressured in some way or are in a state where they are incapable of full consent (such as when asleep, under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or below the age of consent).
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;consent&lt;/a&gt; if they want to terminate their pregnancy. And you might come up against economic barriers: in some places, obtaining an abortion has a cost that is not always covered by insurance and that can be too high for the person trying to terminate their pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever your situation is – don’t give up hope. In many cases, there are systems in place that allow people who can’t otherwise access abortion care to get the medical attention they need in order to obtain a safe and effective procedure. We’re going to go through the obstacles that you might face depending on where you live and what your disposable income is, as well as the different ways around potential access issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaking down the costs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard abortion procedures can be divided into medical and surgical abortions. Medical abortions are obtained by administering a combination of medications - RU486, M&amp;amp;M or the so-called “abortion pills” - that block hormones that are necessary for the pregnancy to grow, stop embryonic cells from multiplying and dividing as they need to to continue a pregnancy, and generate uterine contractions that empty the contents of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#uterus&quot; title=&quot;In people assigned female at birth (unless it has been surgically removed or was not formed in utero), an internal, muscular reproductive organ in the pelvis. During pregnancy, this is where a fetus will develop. When not pregnant, it is the lining of the uterus, when shed each cycle, that provides a menstrual period.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;uterus&lt;/a&gt;. Surgical abortions, on the other hand, mean that the pregnancy is terminated by an experienced doctor with a suction method - either manual vacuum aspiration, dilation and curettage or dilation and evacuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of both medical and surgical abortions can vary greatly depending on where you live, and doesn’t only include the cost of the procedure itself. You may need childcare as well if you already have children, and you may need to consider the costs of taking time off work, school and other appointments. If you can’t order abortion pills to your home, you’ll also need to factor in how much it will cost you to get to the closest clinic (which could be your local hospital or somewhere hundreds of miles away).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, the cost of the procedure tends to vary between $500 and over $2,000.: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guttmacher.org/infographic/2018/states-hostile-abortion-rights-2017&quot;&gt;The prices tend to be higher in “hostile” states&lt;/a&gt;, where reproductive laws are stricter. Late term abortion procedures are also much more expensive, ranging between $8,000 and over $15,000. And your insurance plan won’t likely cover the whole procedure cost unless the abortion is determined to be “medically necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In countries where healthcare is free and universal, and where abortions are legal and accessible in public hospitals and clinics, the procedure is theoretically free, or at least refundable. If you live in Europe, &lt;a href=&quot;http://abortion-clinics.eu/abortion-europe/easy-access-foreign-women/&quot;&gt;this is a great website to check out what the precise policies are in your state&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United Kingdom, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bpas.org/abortion-care/considering-abortion/prices/&quot;&gt;data suggests that 97% of people who have abortions&lt;/a&gt; have their treatment paid for by the National Health Service. In Belgium, abortions are reimbursed if performed in clinics that have signed an agreement with the National Institute for Social Security. Of course, reimbursement models still pose accessibility issues for people who can’t afford to pay for the procedure and then wait to be paid back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s if you can find someone to perform it: some countries have “conscientious objection” laws, which allows individual doctors to abstain from providing abortions. In Italy, for example, 70% of ob-gyns are objectors, meaning that people who want to terminate their pregnancy often have to travel long distances to obtain abortion care - although the procedure itself is completely free when obtained in a public hospital and the patient’s only cost is the price of the medicine they have to take following the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, in countries where abortions are illegal or heavily restricted, prices skyrocket – and so does the potential danger to your health and safety. In these countries, people who want to terminate their pregnancy have to face a tough choice: spending money on the transportation, housing, time off work, child care, etc -- not to mention the procedure itself -- involved in traveling to a different country where abortion is legal, or getting an illegal abortion closer to home and taking on higher health risks and the risk of being criminally charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t despair: There are a lot of options out there for people facing economic, geographic and temporal barriers to accessing abortion care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overcoming the barriers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If abortions are legal in your country (If you’re based in Europe, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://europeabortionaccessproject.org/&quot;&gt;Europe Abortion Access website&lt;/a&gt;), but universal healthcare isn’t, or abortions still have to be paid out-of-pocket, give your insurance company a call and find out what your coverage is. Then, contact the clinic to find out what the cost of the procedure is. Alternatively, in some cases you may have the option of having a medical abortion on your own at home by ordering the mifepristone and Misoprostol pills that are needed to terminate the pregnancy and following the instructions on how to use them. In these cases, the risks are the same as those linked to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#miscarriage&quot; title=&quot;When a pregnancy ends before birth all by itself, often without anyone having done anything to make that happen.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;miscarriage&lt;/a&gt;: unless you run into problems such as high fever or heavy bleeding, it is generally considered to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are having your abortion in a clinic, add in the other side costs that you would have to sustain: transportation to and from the clinic, accommodation and food if you have to stay overnight, childcare costs, and the cost of taking a day off work, among other things. Once you’ve come up with a total figure, decide whether you can afford it on your own. If you don’t think you can, here are some possible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re comfortable with it and it’s a viable option, discussing your situation with your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#partner&quot; title=&quot;In a sexual context, a person with whom someone is having some kind of sex. The term &amp;quot;partner&amp;quot; can be used for all kinds of relationships, not just serious ones. &amp;quot;Partner&amp;quot; can also mean the person someone is with in a romantic or familial partnership.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;partner&lt;/a&gt;, your friends and/or your family is a good place to start. If you think they would be supportive of your decision and they’d be able to help, you might even consider asking them to help you cover the cost, either by loaning or giving you money directly, or helping out with child care, loaning you a car, etc. They may be really glad you asked and gave them an opportunity to support you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re still short on funds after appealing to your community, or if asking people you know isn’t an option, your best bet are abortion funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a great number of abortion funds set up worldwide to provide financial and logistical assistance to people who can’t otherwise afford the costs of an abortion. Most of them serve a particular geographical region, but others work internationally to help people travel abroad to obtain abortions. These groups of people are there to help you juggle and organize all the logistics that could otherwise prove challenging: from travel to childcare, from finding a doula to making sure you have translation services if you have to go to a country where you don’t speak the language, they specialize in helping out people just like you. Funds are usually run by volunteers or by a small staff that takes the calls from people who need a hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way they work changes from association to association, but the basics stay the same: People working with the fund will talk with you privately about what your financial situation is, and to evaluate the estimated cost of your procedure. As the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abortionfunds.org/&quot;&gt;National Network of Abortion Funds’ (NNAF)&lt;/a&gt; FAQ section explains “Every fund has a different amount of money and different requirements, and some have no requirements at all. Because every fund is different, the best thing to do is search for your local fund and give them a call”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, NNAF unites all of the different local funds throughout the country. In Europe, the UK-based &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asn.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Abortion Support Network&lt;/a&gt; mainly helps women from English-speaking countries where abortion is still illegal, such as Northern Ireland, Gibraltar and Malta, and there’s a fund called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.womenonweb.org/&quot;&gt;Women on Web&lt;/a&gt; that works from Denmark. &lt;a href=&quot;https://womenhelp.org/&quot;&gt;Women Help Women&lt;/a&gt; is targeted especially at underfunded countries around the world and specifically does not provide services to the USA and Canada – but it does answer to emails in English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, Polish and Thai to provide medical abortion and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#contraception&quot; title=&quot;Devices, medications or behaviors used to intentionally aim to prevent pregnancy, including the condom, the cervical barrier, the implant, the patch, the pill, the rhythm method, the ring, the shot, the IUD, spermicide and withdrawal.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;contraception&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://abortionfunds.org/fund/maria-abortion-fund-for-social-justice/&quot;&gt;MARIA Abortion Fund for Social Justice&lt;/a&gt; provides funds to low-income people seeking abortion in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you call one of these funds and they don’t pick up in person, don’t hang up! Leave a message with all the information relevant to your situation, and your best contact information. They’ll get back to you as soon as they’re able. If the situation is particularly urgent – as it often is – consider contacting more than one fund at once, if you’re eligible. You can sometimes get help from more than one fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funds will give you as much as they can based on your situation, but they may not be able to pay for the whole cost of your abortion. What they’ll do in all cases, though, is provide expertise, knowledge and logistical help to make sure that the procedure is as low stress as possible for you. If you have to travel for care, having a helping hand that’s familiar with the process and already has contacts with good clinics can be a huge help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mara Clark, an expert who has been working for years with the London-based Abortion Support Network, explains, “We don’t ask our clients how they got pregnant or why they want abortions because rich women don’t have to justify this. We only ask how much money they have and we do our best to help make up the difference. There is often an idea that what people need to get an abortion is a ‘cup of tea’ or a ‘shoulder to cry on’ and while some women may want those things, the fact is what they really need is help with logistical support in navigating abortion restrictions”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since new, restrictive state laws have threatened access to abortion in the United States, countless people on social media have published posts inviting people who need help terminating their pregnancy to contact them for help with money or logistics. Although the intent of these individuals is certainly praiseworthy, it’s still better to rely on official and established funds that have been doing this job for years and know what to do in specific cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know how to do this in a way that makes people feel safe – it’s scary for someone to reach out to a stranger on the Internet, and there are risks of people who are not acting in good faith infiltrating these networks. Also, even if they are acting out of the goodness of their hearts, if someone is not familiar with the logistics, they might not be the best advocate or supporter for the person who needs an abortion”, says Lindsay Rodriguez, communications director of the National Network of Abortion Funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever situation you’re in, you have the human right to terminate your pregnancy if you want to. Despite the limits that governments may try to place on your reproductive choices, there are always activists and volunteers who are working to help you along a path that could otherwise feel lonely or confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you’re not currently considering abortion, and you have the means, you can support people who need to access the procedure by donating to these funds or volunteering yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sexual Assault Exam: An Insiders Guide</title>

We expect them to act “rationally,” like we would, or like we want them to.

But sexual assault is traumatic, and making decisions during and after trauma is complicated. Decisions about who to talk to - the police, a healthcare provider, a friend, a teacher - can feel incredibly complicated. Are they going to believe me? Are they going to listen to me? Are they going to call the police even though I don’t want that? What is going to happen next?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sexual assault is traumatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that isn’t news to anyone, but I think we forget that sometimes when trying to help our friends or family members who are going through it. We expect them to act “rationally,” like we would, or like we want them to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual_assault&quot; title=&quot;When someone is attacked, or attacks someone else, in a sexual way. Doing something sexual to someone who does not want that done to them, often by force or threat, or having something done to you sexually by someone else that is not wanted and/or which you have not consented to.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual assault&lt;/a&gt; is traumatic, and making decisions during and after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#trauma&quot; title=&quot;A serious or critical physical and/or emotional injury or physically and/or emotionally painful experience.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;trauma&lt;/a&gt; is complicated. Decisions about who to talk to - the police, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#healthcare_provider&quot; title=&quot;A qualified person to provide sound physical and/or mental healthcare, such as a doctor, nurse, clinician, counselor, medical assistant, midwife or other healthcare professional.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;healthcare provider&lt;/a&gt;, a friend, a teacher - can feel incredibly complicated. Are they going to believe me? Are they going to listen to me? Are they going to call the police even though I don’t want that? What is going to happen next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just some of the thoughts and concerns that patients have expressed to me during my career as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forensicnurses.org/default.aspx&quot;&gt;forensic nurse&lt;/a&gt; and sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE) I have had a lot of experience in talking to people who have experienced sexual violence. And while I wish I had all the answers, I don’t. I am hoping that I can provide a few answers regarding one of those options where I have a lot of experience - the sexual assault medical forensic examination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the nurse who sees you when you come to the hospital after a sexual assault, I’ve learned that people have really different ideas about what to expect. Sometimes that’s because the ER is so busy you haven’t had a chance to see a physician yet. Sometimes it’s because post-trauma brain has a hard time keeping track of details. And sometimes it’s because TV shows us some really terrible examples of what a sexual assault exam can look like. Hopefully this can help clarify some of the pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One&lt;/em&gt; of the things that I offer patients is the chance to have evidence collected. This evidence consists primarily of the “rape kit” you may have heard about in the media, but other aspects of the exam, like photographs and written documentation, can become evidence as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correct term for the kit is actually a physical evidence recovery kit (PERK) or sexual assault evidence kit (SAEK). At its core it’s a cardboard box, envelopes, and swabs that we use to collect and package potential evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what I do is so much more than collecting a kit. Not all patients even want a kit. So what else happens during a forensic medical exam?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, we are nurses (or sometimes physicians or physicians assistants) so we provide health care. That can look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addressing your urgent medical concerns.&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of patients don’t have any specific medical needs, but some do. It is super common for folks to come in to be checked out after an assault and for me to say, “Physically everything looks okay. I’m still glad you came to the hospital to see me. I hope that having a nurse listen to you and tell you that you’re physically okay can be one small step in helping you move forward from this experience.” But sometimes sexual violence includes physical violence elements as well. So evaluating and treating any cuts, burns, fractures, injuries from strangulation is one piece of what I do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation and treatment for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexually_transmitted_infections&quot; title=&quot;STIs: illness, infection and/or disease which is often or can be transmitted through sexual or other intimate contact, like HIV, Chlamydia or Herpes. Some people call STIs STDs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexually transmitted infections&lt;/a&gt; (STIs).&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/sexual-assault.htm&quot;&gt;Centers for Disease Control recommends preventative treatment for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichamonas as standard treatment for everyone who seeks care following sexual assault&lt;/a&gt;. That means if you had genital, anal, or oral contact during an assault, you should be offered the appropriate medications to prevent those infections. For those STIs we don’t have preventative treatment for (hepatitis C, syphilis), or for which preventative medications require more than a one time dose (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/sexual-assault.htm&quot;&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt;), or that you might already be vaccinated for (hepatitis B, tetanus), we talk about medication, testing, and follow up options to see what makes the most sense for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pregnancy prevention.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#uterus&quot; title=&quot;In people assigned female at birth (unless it has been surgically removed or was not formed in utero), an internal, muscular reproductive organ in the pelvis. During pregnancy, this is where a fetus will develop. When not pregnant, it is the lining of the uterus, when shed each cycle, that provides a menstrual period.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;uterus&lt;/a&gt; I’m going to talk to you about the potential for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#pregnancy&quot; title=&quot;The state of carrying a developing embryo or fetus within the uterus. Medically, someone is considered to be pregnant when an egg has been fertilized by sperm, cells divide, and the fertilized egg is implanted within the lining of the uterus.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; as a result of the assault and offer you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#emergency_contraception&quot; title=&quot;A method of contraception used to prevent pregnancy after sex or rape has already occurred, rather than used before or during, like most types of contraception.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;emergency contraception&lt;/a&gt; (EC) if needed and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bedsider.org/methods/emergency_contraception&quot;&gt;within a time window it would be helpful&lt;/a&gt;. Even if you are taking some types of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#birth_control&quot; title=&quot;Any number of methods people use to intentionally prevent unwanted pregnancy, including the condom, the cervical barrier, the implant, the patch, the pill, the rhythm method, the ring, the shot, the IUD, spermicide and withdrawal.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;birth control&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#condom&quot; title=&quot;A thin sheath or tube of latex or another material, worn over the penis during sex to prevent or reduce the risk of pregnancy and/or sexually transmitted infections.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;condom&lt;/a&gt; was used during the assault, offering EC as additional protection is standard; you should be able to talk over the pros and cons of taking it in your particular situation with your nurse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the number of times in my life I’ve explained what I do, I have also come to recognize some of the most common myths associated with sexual assault care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most common myths I hear about sexual assault exams is that they are long, invasive, and universally terrible. The Netflix series Unbelievable highlights how having a nurse who is focused on the tasks and not on the patient can make this seem true. This is never what an exam should look like. In case you were curious, I have &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; asked a patient to stand naked while I take photographs of them, and no one ever should. An exam that is completed by a forensic nurse examiner who is trained in trauma-informed care as well as evidence collection should never look like this (yup, I just said that twice, that’s how much I mean it). While some of the technical evidence collection pieces are similar to what is shown in the Netflix series (we use swabs to collect evidence, and blue dye to look for injuries), a trained examiner is there for you. I talk to you a lot. I ask you what your concerns are, if you are ok as we go, if you need a break, and if you understand why I’m asking you specific sets of questions. I want you to ask questions, to tell me what you are worried about, and to make sure that we are working together to achieve what you want during the time you are with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every exam is different and tailored to the patient in front of me. Some people want things done as fast as possible, others want time to process and take breaks along the way. On average I’d say I spend about 1.5-2 hours total in the exam room with you during an exam. Some are longer, for example if there are a lot of injuries to photograph, or if I have to coordinate getting a CAT scan, or if I work with the police and advocates to coordinate making sure you have a safe place to go when you leave the hospital. Sometimes it’s faster - if all you want is medications for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#STI&quot; title=&quot;Sexually transmitted infections: illness, infection and/or disease which is often or can be transmitted through sexual or other intimate contact, like HIV, Chlamydia or Herpes. Some people call STIs STDs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;STI&lt;/a&gt; prevention we still have to review some history to make sure you’re getting the right medications, but its quicker than a full exam with evidence collection. While an exam has several standard parts, it is also a “Choose Your Own Adventure” in that not every patient wants all the pieces. (And because its a hospital, there is also some paperwork and waiting that can sometimes make the whole process longer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three primary components make up the exam: history taking, a head-to-toe physical examination, and the option of evidence collection. You can opt into or out of any of these components, or even just parts of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History taking.&lt;/strong&gt; We ask a lot of questions. About your medical history, about the specific things that happened to you that brought you to the hospital (so we know what body parts touched what body parts and where we should be evaluating closely for injury and swabbing for potential evidence). If the event included strangulation, we want to make sure we look closely at your eyes, behind your ears, in your mouth, and may ask for additional imaging tests. If there was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#kissing&quot; title=&quot;Pressing one&amp;#039;s lips against someone else&amp;#039;s lips or some other body part to express affection and/or to seek out or provide sexual pleasure. May also include the tongue.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;kissing&lt;/a&gt;, licking, or biting, we want to make sure to swab the areas that were invo.ved. Did you lose consciousness or have gaps in your memory? We may want to send extra labs to test for drugs and alcohol. These tests are not designed to penalize you, they are because we are concerned about whether or not you were able to provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#consent&quot; title=&quot;To agree to do something or give permission. In the context of sex, a person is giving full consent/is consenting when they freely and actively agree to do something sexual with someone else; however, the person still has the right to change their mind at any point. A person is NOT consenting if they do not actively agree, have been forced or pressured in some way or are in a state where they are incapable of full consent (such as when asleep, under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or below the age of consent).
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;consent&lt;/a&gt; as a result of substance you might have been given or taken voluntarily. The most common “date rape” drug is alcohol, and knowing how much alcohol is left in your body when you come to the hospital can be helpful in court sometimes. We also ask a lot of questions about things that matter to us when we do an exam or when evidence is examined by the crime lab that patients might not remember to tell us otherwise - like have you had consensual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; in the past week? Or have you ever had an STI? Remember, everything about this exam is voluntary, so if you aren’t comfortable with any of these questions or these tests, we can skip them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical examination.&lt;/strong&gt; This shouldn’t look terribly different than any other trip to see your primary care or sexual health care provider. The nurse usually starts at your head and works down, asking about pain and other symptoms you might be having and writing things down as they go. You should always be able to keep some clothes on. We do often ask to take the clothes you wore to the hospital and/or when the assault happened as part of the evidence, so it can be more physically and mentally comfortable if you bring (or have someone bring you) an extra set of comfy clothes to wear when you’re done, instead of fighting with the one-size-fits-nobody hospital scrubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evidence collection.&lt;/strong&gt; During the exam, the forensic nurse might collect swabs from your mouth, neck, chest, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#genitals&quot; title=&quot;External sexual or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;genitals&lt;/a&gt;, etc. based on the history. We will also ask to take a standard DNA sample from you (a cheek swab, or drop of blood) as a reference sample for the lab. Photographs are often a part of this process - especially if you have visible injuries. The nurse may use an alternate light source to look for potential injuries or evidence on your body during this stage as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again: all parts of a medical forensic exam are voluntary - no one (not your parents, not a physician or nurse, not the police) can force you to have any part of an exam you don’t want. My goal is to support you in making the decision that is best for you in that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s bust another common myth: I don’t work for the police. I’m a nurse and I work for a hospital. My primary goal is to provide patient care. This includes awesome evidence collection and, if you decide to report, collaborating with the police to make sure they receive the kit with an intact chain of custody. But I don’t collect things just because the police ask me to, and I don’t make patients talk to the police if they don’t want to, unless the law forces me to. (More on that in a minute). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.evawintl.org/PAGEID2/Forensic-Compliance/Background&quot;&gt;In the United States you are entitled to have someone like me collect forensic evidence without making a report to law enforcement.&lt;/a&gt; How exactly this gets enacted varies from state to state (and sometimes city to city). For example, some places will hold evidence for &lt;a href=&quot;http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2017RS/chapters_noln/Ch_159_hb0255T.pdf&quot;&gt;20 years in order for patients to have time to change their mind and make a report&lt;/a&gt;. In others regions it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/dcj/reporting-options&quot;&gt;two years&lt;/a&gt;, and there a variety of local laws that fall in between those two points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the legal stuff: if you’re under 18, &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.rainn.org/policy/&quot;&gt;some states&lt;/a&gt; require reporting of sexual assault as child &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#abuse&quot; title=&quot;Purposeful harm or mistreatment of another person, which can be verbal, emotional, physical or sexual. An ongoing pattern or cycle of such mistreatment or harm can characterize an abusive relationship.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;abuse&lt;/a&gt;. In most states with this kind of law, the report goes to the local child protective services agency, but it’s not the same everywhere. Similarly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ndaa.org/wp-content/uploads/Minor-Consent-to-Medical-Treatment-2.pdf&quot;&gt;some states&lt;/a&gt; may require your parent to sign the consent form along with you saying that you having the exam is okay. In both these cases, neither the child protective services or your parents can make you have the exam if you tell me you don’t want it, but unfortunately they do throw up some extra barriers for folks in some places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also don’t work alone. I work with amazing sexual violence advocates. While I am there to provide you high quality, evidence-based, trauma-informed healthcare and evidence collection during a hospital visit, advocates are there to help you through all the other stuff that comes with surviving sexual violence. They are usually associated with the local &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#rape&quot; title=&quot;When one person does a sexual act to, on, or inside another person who does not want to participate; who refuses to participate and/or who does not or is unable to fully and freely consent to take part in that activity.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;rape&lt;/a&gt; crisis system and provide services like hotlines, emergency shelter, legal assistance, and partnerships with mental health and counceling services. They can provide you with important support and follow up that is outside my nurse sandbox. Ideally, you are lucky enough (as I have been) to be some place where advocates are available 24/7/365 to come to the hospital and be with you before, during, and after the exam. At this point, their role is to focus 100% on supporting you when I am focusing on collecting a sample, taking a photograph, or documenting in your health record. If not there are still some awesome options, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/bb/&quot;&gt;message boards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/our_live_chat_service&quot;&gt;live chat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/text_scarleteen&quot;&gt;text services&lt;/a&gt; offered by the great folks right here at Scarleteen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a sexual assault exam means that something terrible has already happened. But the exam itself should not be traumatic. You have the right to always: be in control of what is happening, be able to stop at any time, decide what pieces you want and don’t want, and be offered options to help you address your physical, psychological, and forensic concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it can be scary to decide to what to do after a sexual assault. Those Scarleteen support lines I mentioned earlier are an awesome first place to reach out if you are unsure about what to do or how to help someone else going through this situation. Free, anonymous, confidential, and they can help you talk through the specifics of your situation in ways that an online article can’t do. If you decide to go to the hospital they can help you find one with a forensic nurse on staff. If you decide to talk to the police they can help connect you to your local advocacy services to be with you when you make that call. Or you can just chat with them whatever you decide is okay. That’s the whole point - you should be getting to make the choices.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sexual Harassment in Your Workplace: What to Know, and What You Can Do</title>

And what can you actually do about it, whether you’re the target of it, trying to avoid harming people yourself, or you’re the friend of someone who’s being harassed at work?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Workplace &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual&quot; title=&quot;About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; harassment has been in the news in a big way over the last couple of years. But many of the stories we hear are about Hollywood or big corporations, and we often only hear the stories of the most egregious misconduct, not the kinds of comments, “jokes,” or mistreatment that can make us uncomfortable on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a young worker -- someone who works for a small family business, or waits tables at a restaurant, or lifeguards at a pool over summer break, for example -- it can often be hard to see yourself in those stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is sexual harassment likely to look like in your life, or the lives of your friends? And what can you actually do about it, whether you’re the target of it, trying to avoid harming people yourself, or you’re the friend of someone who’s being harassed at work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defining our terms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people hear “sexual” harassment, they often think the behavior has to be related to sexual activity, but that’s only part of it. Sexual harassment has a few different elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sexual harassment involves words, conduct, or actions that are sexual in nature, or which are connected to a person or group’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender&quot; title=&quot;Characteristics that are seen or presented as distinguishing between male and female in a society. Gender may or may not include assigned or chosen: social roles, feelings, behaviors and/or presentation or appearance.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender_expression&quot; title=&quot;The way people externally communicate gender identity to others through their behavior and their outward, chosen appearance.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender expression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual_orientation&quot; title=&quot;A term -- like homosexual, heterosexual, bisexual, queer, straight, lesbian, gay, asexual -- used to describe a person&amp;#039;s usual or current pattern of emotional, romantic and/or sexual attraction to other people in terms of gender.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual orientation&lt;/a&gt;, or any other gender-related characteristic, AND which have the purpose or effect of demeaning, degrading, or distressing another person, unreasonably interfering with someone’s work performance, or contributing to an intimidating, offensive, or hostile work environment. So If your coworker is telling you that you shouldn’t wear a particular type of clothing because it’s too &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#feminine&quot; title=&quot;Describes something society associates with or attributes to women and girls or a state, experience or assignment of being female.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;feminine&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#masculine&quot; title=&quot;Describes something society associates with or attributes to men and boys or a state, experience or assignment of being male.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;masculine&lt;/a&gt;, or if they’re making fun of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gay&quot; title=&quot;In the context of sexuality, a word for sexual orientation which either describes a man who is sexually and emotionally attracted to other men, or a person of any sex or gender who is sexually and emotionally attracted to people of the same or a similar sex or gender. Often used alongside lesbian.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gay&lt;/a&gt; or trans people, or saying that girls and women don’t belong in a particular profession, AND them doing that makes you feel uncomfortable, unable to focus at work, or like you aren’t welcome in that workplace, it might constitute what we call a “hostile work environment.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sexual harassment also refers to &lt;em&gt;quid pro quo&lt;/em&gt; sexual harassment, which involves the offer of improved treatment or other work-related reward in exchange for engaging in sexual behavior, the threat of poor treatment or work-related consequences for refusing to engage in sexual behavior, and other implicit or explicit work-related sexual coercion. For example: if a boss promises you a raise, says you can get better shifts, or tells you that you can have a job if you engage in sexual conduct with them, or if they say you’ll get fired or they will otherwise treat you badly at work if you don’t do it, then that might be a &lt;em&gt;quid pro quo &lt;/em&gt;situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language above is pulled from legal definitions of sexual harassment, and can be pretty vague or difficult to understand. The law, itself, isn’t always very specific about which behaviors constitute sexual harassment, because a lot of it comes down to subjective interpretations of what any given person finds offensive, and how it affects them at work. &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-need-a-better-way-to-talk-about-sexual-misconduct/&quot;&gt;Check out the chart from Professor Louise Fitzgerald in this article&lt;/a&gt; (about ⅔ of the way down the page). She helps break down the types of behaviors we’re talking about, and groups them in ways that help us understand sexual harassment beyond the very specific legal categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember that you can be harmed by or be responsible for engaging in sexual or gender-based harassment no matter what your gender is. Straight men might harass straight women, like we see portrayed most often. But a gay man making derogatory or overly sexualized comments about his nonbinary coworker’s body isn’t okay either. Neither are invasive questions or mockery about a guy’s sexual orientation or preferred sexual activities from his colleagues, or anyone at work asking a woman repeated questions about when she’s planning to get pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sexual harassment can happen at your actual place of work, or it can happen outside of work, like when a coworker texts you inappropriate messages, or if you’re traveling for a conference. The person doing the harassing can be your boss or coworker, but it could also be a security guard at the front desk, or a regular customer, or a vendor. Your employer must keep you safe from harassment from anyone that you are required to come into contact with as a result of your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you, a coworker, or a friend may be experiencing sexual harassment from a particular individual or group of individuals, and each of us should strive to treat each other well at work, it’s important to remember that the responsibility for preventing harassment, responding to it when it happens, and preventing it from recurring is ultimately your employer’s responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your employer’s responsibilities?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once your employer knows about sexual harassment -- or about discrimination of any kind, like on the basis of race, disability, or any other &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/discrimination-employment.aspx&quot;&gt;federal, state, or local protected class&lt;/a&gt; -- they are generally required to take action to stop it and to prevent it from recurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your employer should have a policy that states that they don’t tolerate harassment or discrimination, and which outlines how you can report it to the company or organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be scary to report -- you might be worried that someone won’t believe you, or that someone will retaliate and you could lose your job; your boss might be the one engaged in the misconduct -- and your fears are totally understandable and valid. Reporting through official workplace channels definitely isn’t the right solution for everyone, but if you think you can pursue it safely, it can be your best option for getting the behavior to stop. Remember, your employer can’t fix something if they don’t know that it’s a problem. Check out the section below on what to do if you or someone you know are experiencing harassment for some other ideas and alternatives for how to address it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once your employer knows about possible sexual harassment, no matter how they know -- whether because you or someone else told them directly, or someone reported it anonymously, or a supervisor saw it happening, or because your manager overheard people talking about it -- they have to address it. If you know that they know, or should have reason to know, and they don’t adequately address the harassment, then you can talk to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eeoc.gov/employees/charge.cfm&quot;&gt;Equal Employment Opportunity Commission&lt;/a&gt; or your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nolo.com/FEPA&quot;&gt;state or local fair employment practices agency&lt;/a&gt;, who enforce laws and make sure that employers are following the rules on preventing and responding to harassment and discrimination. You may want to talk with one of these outside agencies if you don’t feel safe pursuing a complaint at work, your employer already knows about the harassment but isn’t adequately addressing it, or if you need additional guidance on your rights or what to do next. These conversations are free, and you don’t need to have a lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, a private employer has to have 15 or more employees in order to be bound by the laws that the EEOC enforces, but that can vary from state to state, and sometimes based on the type of place you work. Many state and local anti-discrimination laws are stricter than what’s covered under the federal law that the EEOC enforces, so you may be covered under one of those laws or regulations. If you’ve experienced something you think might be sexual harassment, and you want to know what your options are for handling it, check with the EEOC or with your state or local employment agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does this matter for workers like you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sexual harassment exists in nearly every type of work environment, in nearly every industry, from work study programs to summer jobs delivering pizzas to retail work to working in your family friend’s law office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that younger workers are often most vulnerable to sexual harassment. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/107780102400447087&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; of high school students working part-time jobs found that 2 in 3 girls and 1 in 3 boys reported experiencing sexual harassment at work. Sixty-one percent of that harassment came from coworkers, 19 percent from supervisors, and 18 percent from customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early jobs you work when you’re in high school or college, or entering the workforce as a young adult, are your first introductions to how to behave at work. This is where you learn what “normal” is. If you’re new to the workforce, you might not have a good understanding yet of acceptable workplace behaviors. That can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/task_force/harassment/report.cfm#_Toc453686305&quot;&gt;increase the risk of harassment&lt;/a&gt; in that first or second job you hold, and even into the future. Many younger workers don’t feel able to say no to sexual advances that might make them uncomfortable, and don’t feel like they can or know how to report misconduct. And if, in our earliest working experiences, we learn that certain kinds of behaviors are actually acceptable, sometimes we go on to replicate or perpetuate harmful or damaging actions in future work environments. This helps create unhealthy workplace cultures throughout our society, and could result in you being harmed, or in harming others, later in your career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should you do if you or a coworker are being harassed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sexual harassment to be illegal, it usually needs to be “severe” or “pervasive,” meaning it has to have been either really intensely bad or something that’s happening in an ongoing way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But just because the harassment might not be illegal does not mean that it’s acceptable. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a boss, coworker, customer, or anyone else you have to come into contact with as a result of your work is making you feel uncomfortable, you always have the right to let someone know and get help in making that behavior stop. If you don’t feel able to bring it up with your supervisor, or with their supervisor, try talking to a parent, teacher, or other trusted adult. You can also contact the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eeoc.gov/employees/charge.cfm&quot;&gt;Equal Employment Opportunity Commission&lt;/a&gt;, or your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nolo.com/FEPA&quot;&gt;state or local&lt;/a&gt; equivalent. Another resource is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://youngworkers.org/rights/teenworkers/#what-if-i-am-being-sexually-harassed-at-work&quot;&gt;Young Workers Project&lt;/a&gt; of the Labor Occupational Health Program at University of California at Berkeley. They can advise you on next steps to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are experiencing sexual or gender-based harassment, or you see or hear about it happening to someone else, you have a lot of power and tools available to you to make it stop. Bystander intervention is one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asanet.org/news-events/footnotes/jun-jul-aug-2019/research-policy/bystander-intervention-prevention-strategies-solution-addressing-sexual-harassment-and-assault&quot;&gt;most effective ways&lt;/a&gt; to stop harassment, and to show people who have been harmed by harassment that we have their back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One option is to directly tell the person to cut it out or that their comments are unwelcome, whether they’re directed at you or at someone else. But less directly, you can also go talk to the person who was harmed by the harassment afterwards and say “hey, I didn’t think what John said earlier was okay. How are you doing? How can I support you in making sure that doesn’t happen again?” Or you can go talk to the person who made the inappropriate comment and tell them that you didn’t think the joke was funny, or that you felt it was really inappropriate, and think they owe someone an apology. You can also just inject yourself into a situation; if you see someone being cornered by a coworker that you know they don’t feel comfortable with, go over and join the conversation. Start talking about the weather, or your plans for that weekend. Something as simple as just being there makes it so the person doing the harassing has to stop, or will walk away, or gives the person who’s being harmed in that moment the ability to get away without it being a big thing. Even if you don’t think you know the right thing to say in any given moment, just being there or responding to a crass joke with a quick “wow, really?” can let someone know their behavior is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple steps like these can make a big impact in changing workplace cultures into safer environments for everyone. Our workplace cultures are shaped by the behaviors that we do and do not tolerate. When we intervene, tell someone their behavior is unacceptable, or support people in objecting to harassment, discrimination, or mistreatment, we are actively shaping the norms of what is okay and what is not in our environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And always remember -- the harassment doesn’t have to be directed at you for it to affect you. If someone’s behavior at work is making you uncomfortable, even if the comment or sexual advances they made were targeted at your coworker or a customer, you still have every right to object to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you can take actions to respond or intervene, ultimately it’s your employer’s responsibility to create and maintain a work environment that is free from harassment and discrimination. Ask your employer if they have a policy in place, and make sure that it’s been distributed to and reviewed with all employees. If they haven’t already, and even if it’s not required by state or local laws, your employer should provide training to all employees on what sexual harassment is, what their policies are, and how to report if someone needs to.

 <title>Expressing Your Needs Isn’t Asking Somebody For “Favors”</title>

For individuals on the Autism spectrum or anyone with some kind of disability, it can be an especially trying task. Here&amp;#039;s a little advice from someone who knows.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;It can be hard for anybody to ask for help. For individuals on the Autism spectrum or anyone with some kind of disability, it can be an &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; trying task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All my life, I’ve been keenly aware that I’m on the spectrum, and that this means there are certain things I’ll just always struggle with. I’ve also been aware that most of the people in my life — from relatives to teachers — will be aware of my Autism and (what I feel are) my shortcomings stemming from it. From a young age, I’ve been immensely self-conscious about asking for Autism-related help from people in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always had a burning &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#desire&quot; title=&quot;A feeling of strongly wanting something. In the context of sex, desire can be a strong feeling of a physical and psychological want for any kind of sex.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;desire&lt;/a&gt; to be as independent as possible. I’ve wanted to prove to everyone that I could do everything on my own despite being Autistic. I’ve worked hard to avoid asking for assistance that I presumed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#adults&quot; title=&quot;People older than you who probably drive you batty. Or, people whose age in years exceeds the legal age of majority; people considered to be adults by law.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;adults&lt;/a&gt; in my life expected I would need. These were desires born partially out of hubris, and partially out of self-consciousness. I felt like asking for help would call attention to my Autism and all my struggles connected to it. At school, I already felt like all eyes were on me as the lone Autistic kid in the class: I preferred to keep my head down rather than calling any more attention to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I’ve gotten older, the circumstances of struggling to ask for help with Autism-related matters has changed, but it still persists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve managed to better understand the necessity of asking for help, and I&#039;ve gotten a little better at doing it. Unfortunately, my &lt;i&gt;desire&lt;/i&gt; to keep my head down instead of asking for help that I need hasn’t changed much. An ADHD diagnosis just before my first year of college left me feeling like there were now even more personal foibles that I had to learn to ask people for help with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a bad tendency of looking at situations where I’m out of my element as an opportunity to prove my independence rather than ask for assistance so that I can do the situation possible. I obviously also feel like asking for help is bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you can relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m taking the chance today, and making a stretch, to write something I try to tell myself every time I struggle to ask for help so I can get better at this: &lt;strong&gt;people aren’t doing us any sort of “favor” by merely recognizing that we’re out of our element or anxious, by recognizing that we simply have a need for help, and making room for us in that way. &lt;/strong&gt;And yes, this very much extends to making our personal needs known to dating or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual&quot; title=&quot;About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to write that down. It’s hard to actually go out and live, and ask for help, with that firmly in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of my own anxiety over a prospective &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#romantic&quot; title=&quot;Of, or relating to, intimate or passionate love or interest.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;romantic&lt;/a&gt; interaction with another person is that they’ll do the most basic of interactions with me simply out of pity. This makes the idea of going much further and asking that person to be cognizant of certain needs I have as a person on the Autism spectrum utterly petrifying, even as someone who can write a piece like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But though it’s often difficult to actually make our needs known, it’s vital to know it’s valuable to do that with people we care about (or want to) and who care about us. Valuable to us, valuable to them, valuable to everyone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any basically healthy, equitable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#relationship&quot; title=&quot;Some kind of ongoing interaction or association with another person, place or thing.

There are all kinds of relationships: family relationships, friendships, romantic relationships, and sexual relationships. Sometimes there is an overlap where we have more than one kind of relationship with someone. Sometimes people use the word relationship to only mean a romantic, &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot;, or committed relationship, even though that&amp;#039;s not all this word means.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;relationship&lt;/a&gt; involves people being made aware of and then honoring each other’s basic needs, whether that relationship includes a person on the Autism spectrum or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, one person in a romantic relationship letting the other person know they have an allergy to shellfish can be integral to figuring out places they can go out to eat without risking a severe allergic reaction. A person telling their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#partner&quot; title=&quot;In a sexual context, a person with whom someone is having some kind of sex. The term &amp;quot;partner&amp;quot; can be used for all kinds of relationships, not just serious ones. &amp;quot;Partner&amp;quot; can also mean the person someone is with in a romantic or familial partnership.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;partner&lt;/a&gt; about their intense fear of heights helps them both avoid doing anything that would make both suffer needlessly, and lets that partner know they should ask how to be supportive if and when heights just can’t be avoided. Someone who has just suffered a loss who talks to their partner about it and asks for support is, in doing that, giving their partner an opportunity to actually &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt; a partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are always individual needs in any relationship, including those where everyone involved is both neurotypical and able. Are neurotypical or able people who respond with the most basic kindness and consideration to their partners needs doing their partners a “favor?” Of course not. They’re just making the adjustments they need to in order to be in a healthy, caring relationship to their partner as the person they are, their needs included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needs that stem from being on the Autism spectrum, similar disorders, or disabilities, are just like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking people you&#039;re in intimate relationships with to be conscious of those needs and to help you with them to the best of their abilities — and within healthy boundaries, of course — is totally reasonable and is &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;asking a for a “favor.”  In intimate relationships, we’re &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to support each other in basic ways. Helping each other with our needs is a great way of doing just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dynamic can extend to any sort of relationship or interaction, not just romantic ones. The dynamics you share with your co-workers. Dynamics between you and your friends. On and on it goes. All those personal relationships and interactions you share with people should involve your specific needs being known, seen and honored. Even if people in your life know something about you — like that you have Autism, ADD or anxiety — they know a lot about, they still can’t know your &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; needs because of those things unless you tell them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initiating these conversations is important, particularly for people with differences or disabilities, especially in one major way: they give you agency. They let &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; be the one to say what specific needs you have and what you need when it comes to those needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said earlier, that’s not easy to do. It’s daunting. So far, I can’t even say for myself that it ever becomes that much easier: the anxiety associated with being this open with other people always persists for me and still makes me want to just keep my head down and not speak up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just keeping our heads down may seem better in the moment, but it’s not the way we can grow as people, really connect with others, or get what we need with our specific disabilities. Plus, each time you ask for help, you do get better at it, even if it doesn&#039;t always feel that way. Asking over time helps you to learn how to best convey your needs so people get it, and also makes it feel a little less daunting each time you ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for specific ways to make your asking for help as effective as possible, I’ve got a few basic tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, try and keep things concise and specific. I personally have an issue of overtalking: my sentences can be packed with useless words. I’ve been learning to keep my asks streamlined and direct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frame requests for help as a question rather than a demand. That’s just good manners and something I had to learn myself. Too, make sure to express gratitude once you’ve been given assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with these tips in mind, it still can be easier said than done when it comes to asking for assistance. To do so is to be vulnerable, to recognize our own shortcomings and that’s always an awkward process. But here’s the thing: all of us are vulnerable. None of us are perfect. Nobody has all the answers. To quote Ethan Hawke’s Dad from &lt;i&gt;Boyhood&lt;/i&gt;, “We’re all just winging it, you know?” Knowing that doesn’t automatically erase the awkwardness you feel asking for help but just know, when you do ask for assistance, that you’re not the only one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all need to be open and vulnerable if we’re going to get the help we need. Through others recognizing your own needs, this isn’t a form of people “doing favors” for you. It&#039;s just basic human kindness and you’re deserving of that. We all are.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;meta  itemprop=&quot;name&quot; content=&quot;Expressing Your Needs Isn’t Asking Somebody For “Favors”&quot; id=&quot;md16&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-article-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;img itemprop=&quot;image&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/sites/files/scarleteen/article_images/2_0.png&quot; alt=&quot;photo of person treaching for help while drowning with thought bubble that says &amp;quot;Expressing your needs isn&amp;#039;t asking somebody for favors&amp;quot; and text that reads: a little help from one person with autism to another&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-taxonomy-vocabulary-3 field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/needs&quot;&gt;needs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/help&quot;&gt;help&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/asking&quot;&gt;asking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/favor&quot;&gt;favor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/care&quot;&gt;care&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/kindness&quot;&gt;kindness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/humanity&quot;&gt;humanity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/disability&quot;&gt;disability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/autism&quot;&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/autistic&quot;&gt;autistic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/identity&quot;&gt;identity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/selfconscious&quot;&gt;self-conscious&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/learning&quot;&gt;learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/growing&quot;&gt;growing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/intimacy&quot;&gt;intimacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/partnership&quot;&gt;partnership&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/relationships&quot;&gt;relationships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/respect&quot;&gt;respect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/positive_risk&quot;&gt;positive risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/practice&quot;&gt;practice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-taxonomy-vocabulary-1 field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/taxonomy/term/5630&quot;&gt;Disability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/taxonomy/term/7&quot;&gt;Relationships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>For the love of they, them and we who use them.</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/for_the_love_of_they_them_and_we_who_use_them</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At long last, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2019/09/17/merriam-webster-adds-non-binary-prounoun-they-dictionary/&quot;&gt;Merriam-Webster has added they and them, as singular nonbinary pronouns, specifically, to the dictionary&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of us who are nonbinary, who use these pronouns, or both, didn&#039;t need a dictionary to validate our identities, or the pronouns we use.  Anyone and everyone&#039;s identities and pronouns are valid, whether the dictionary or other cultural institutions acknowledge them or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#039;s say that again, just for good measure, as well as for those who still don&#039;t yet have the privilege: &lt;strong&gt;everyone&#039;s identities and pronouns are valid, whether the dictionary or other cultural institutions acknowledge them or not&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They and them in this kind of use were grammatically correct and in use for a very, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; long time -- at least all the way back to the 1300 in the English language alone, a thing our pals at Merriam-Webster &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they&quot;&gt;have not only already backed us up on&lt;/a&gt;, but explain the context of pretty nicely, so I hopefully can be done, finally, with having to say much more about it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respectfully -- I say that because I was a child who literally read the dictionary front to back by choice; I have a level of reverence for the dictionary that borders on religious -- they do miss the mark a bit in that blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some, being nonbinary or using they/them is, as they say, about being (they actually say &lt;em&gt;&quot;seeming,&quot;&lt;/em&gt; which is awfully cringeworthy, so I&#039;m going to just say being instead and hope that someone takes the hint) neither male or female, or man or woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For others, it&#039;s more complex, dimensional or just plain different than that. It might be about being outside or beyond that whole system of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender&quot; title=&quot;Characteristics that are seen or presented as distinguishing between male and female in a society. Gender may or may not include assigned or chosen: social roles, feelings, behaviors and/or presentation or appearance.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt; so completely -- as is often the case for people who identify as non-gendered -- to the point that &quot;neither&quot; doesn&#039;t make sense, much like describing a tomato as &quot;neither suitable building material for an office building nor a reliable means of human transportation,&quot; wouldn&#039;t be a sound way of talking about the systems tomatoes are even any remotely feasible part of. If you just don&#039;t feel any attachment or orientation within a system at all, or maybe don&#039;t even believe in its essential existence, &quot;neither&quot; in reference to that system and you just might not work at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They/them or being nonbinary can also be about being -- sometimes, as is the case for many genderfluid people, or even all the time -- a nonbinary man or a woman (or both, or all: these things aren&#039;t &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#exclusive&quot; title=&quot;Something that is not divided or shared with others; which excludes others based on a given criteria.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;exclusive&lt;/a&gt; in nonbinary frameworks like they are in binary ones), but not feeling, experiencing, or presenting those as binary, where there are only two genders or sexes, or where they are framed as opposites or two parts of one whole. Those are just a couple examples. Nonbinary identities, they/them pronouns, and the people who use them have a wide range of experiences and expressions, and it&#039;s usually about a lot more than just not fitting into male/female or man/woman.  For more on this, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nonbinary.miraheze.org/wiki/List_of_nonbinary_identities&quot;&gt;this wiki is a good place to start&lt;/a&gt;, and so is Archie Bongiovanni and Tristan Jimerson&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.archiebongiovanni.com/A-Quick-And-Easy-Guide-To-They-Them-Pronouns&quot;&gt;Quick and Easy Guide to They/Them Pronouns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recent addition to the dictionary isn&#039;t about they/them being brand new, so much as having evolved to have an additional, common use over the last few decades, and this change doesn&#039;t make they/them correct when they weren&#039;t before. &lt;strong&gt;This recent addition is, one hopes, about recognizing and acknowledging a use of these words that has become common and -- and this is the best part -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://consciousstyleguide.com/gender-sex-sexuality/&quot;&gt;recognizing and acknowledging the existence of those of us who use those words and others like them in this way and supporting us in language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also gives those of us who use they/them the ability to at least say, &lt;em&gt;&quot;Go look it up in the dictionary,&quot;&lt;/em&gt; which is going to be an awfully nice break from the myriad arguments, defenses and sometimes out-and-out fights we all get constantly cornered into engaging in, with way too many people, if and when we have the audacity to ask people to just call us what we want to be called. Thanks, Merriam-Webster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&#039;m also hoping -- for all of us, myself very much included -- this might help to more quickly usher in the end of:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Articles announcing someone uses they/them pronouns that STILL misgender them, for crying out loud (Sam Smith literally told the whole world their pronouns, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.out.com/celebs/2019/9/14/ap-misgendered-sam-smith-article-about-their-pronouns&quot;&gt;and the AP reported on that &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;using the wrong pronouns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, something that had to be way harder and far more brain-breaky than just using the pronouns Sam handed over so clearly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Reading pieces that, when using my pronoun -- a thing I, like most people who use they/them, usually have to work very hard to get people to include in the first place -- say things like, &quot;Heather, who prefers they/them pronouns...&quot; That&#039;s &lt;em&gt;never &lt;/em&gt;written about people who use he or she: neither that they &quot;prefer&quot; he or she, nor that they use he or she. Instead, their pronouns just get used without comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While we&#039;re here, good form with this is not &quot;prefers.&quot; Our pronouns are our pronouns, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#period&quot; title=&quot;The fluid, which contains blood, from the shedding of the uterine lining usually at the end of each fertility cycle. Or, that flow you perhaps may have experienced once while shouting, &amp;quot;Oh thank GAWD!&amp;quot;&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;period&lt;/a&gt;; they are the pronouns we use. I &lt;/em&gt;prefer&lt;em&gt; people call me by my first name, not my full name. T&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;hey/them are my pronouns. Easy, right? To say which pronouns a person uses in context, you don&#039;t usually need to say which pronouns they use &lt;whatever pronouns=&quot;&quot;&gt; then use them. When people complain that using they/them is wordy or awkward, it&#039;s usually because the way &lt;/whatever&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;whatever pronouns=&quot;&quot;&gt;they&lt;/whatever&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;whatever pronouns=&quot;&quot;&gt; are doing it is wordy and awkward. You can just cut right to it and use the pronoun like you do with he or she, like, &quot;Though King Henry II used the royal we, he was only ever speaking for himself.&quot;&lt;/whatever&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Having to choose between he or she on things -- including things that identify us to others in very lasting or powerful ways, and sometimes matter more than how we ourselves &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; identify -- when we don&#039;t want to choose either, and when everyone should have a third option that can literally be used by everyone, anyway, no matter how they identify. Having a gender-neutral option -- on all things -- just makes sense, and not just for nonbinary people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Having to explain at the beginning of books or articles I write that I use they/them for myself and others, what it means, and ask people to go along with that as if I were asking them to engage in some kind of hard labor rather than just acknowledging our identities like they do for themselves and others who use he/she.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Experiencing someone painfully try and ask what pronouns a person uses while trying not to use he or she, when they can instead just say, &quot;What pronouns do they use?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ideally, people would and will respect our identities and our pronouns, dictionary inclusion or not. But, alas: we don&#039;t live in an ideal world, we live in this one.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I&#039;m not the only one who&#039;s got some feelings about people who NOW will get on board because of the authority dictionaries are afforded, but wouldn&#039;t before when we -- the very best authority on ourselves -- told them who were were and what our pronouns are. Or people who will say that their only issue was that it was apparently not grammatically correct before, and has been deemed so now, not only because that&#039;s now what has actually happened, but because we all know that was never their actual issue. Their actual issue was that they didn&#039;t accept or want to acknowledge our identities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that sounds like you, I think you&#039;ve got a great opportunity here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this makes you feel able to finally get on board with this right now, all the way? You can do so without cloaking it in a bunch of malarkey about how it was just about grammar or lack of apparent proper locutionary authority. (We know it wasn&#039;t.) You can instead just do it in the very best way, the way that feels the most affirming for all of us, and make it about accepting us, and the words we use because WE say. Even better, if you&#039;ve got other identities or their words you&#039;re still not accepting yet, you can work on changing that now, instead of waiting for the dictionary to do it first. &lt;3&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;meta  itemprop=&quot;name&quot; content=&quot;For the love of they, them and we who use them.&quot; id=&quot;md17&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-taxonomy-vocabulary-3 field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/theythem&quot;&gt;they/them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/they&quot;&gt;they&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/them&quot;&gt;them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/genderneutral&quot;&gt;gender-neutral&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/nonbinary&quot;&gt;nonbinary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/dictionary&quot;&gt;dictionary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/words&quot;&gt;words&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/language&quot;&gt;language&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/identity&quot;&gt;identity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/respect&quot;&gt;respect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/affirming&quot;&gt;affirming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/gender&quot;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/binary&quot;&gt;binary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/merriamwebster&quot;&gt;Merriam-Webster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/culture&quot;&gt;culture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/change&quot;&gt;change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/pronouns&quot;&gt;pronouns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-author field-type-text field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Author:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Heather Corinna&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>It&#039;s Quickies! Our new series of short, fast, sex ed summaries!</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/its_quickies_our_new_series_of_short_fast_sex_ed_summaries</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/Quickies_%20Article%20Images.png&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: right; width: 250px; height: 250px;&quot; /&gt;Over the years, we’ve had many Scarleteen fans -- especially older siblings, aunts and uncles, cousins, camp counselors, babysitters or other folks who’ve loved Scarleteen for themselves and wanted to pass its goodness on to the younger people in their lives -- ask if they should refer preteens to our site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, most of our content is aimed at and made expressly for those who are in their mid-to-late teens or their early-to-mid twenties. Our readers and users have generally wanted and most appreciated in-depth, longer pieces with information and approaches most relevant for their age groups. Our content can work for some younger readers, but in general, due to its length and depth alone, it just usually isn&#039;t that accessible for most younger readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the subject matter we cover also won’t be all that relevant for them: preteens or very young teens, for instance, aren’t typically going to need to manage long-term &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual&quot; title=&quot;About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; relationships, sexual healthcare or more complicated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#relationship&quot; title=&quot;Some kind of ongoing interaction or association with another person, place or thing.

There are all kinds of relationships: family relationships, friendships, romantic relationships, and sexual relationships. Sometimes there is an overlap where we have more than one kind of relationship with someone. Sometimes people use the word relationship to only mean a romantic, &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot;, or committed relationship, even though that&amp;#039;s not all this word means.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;relationship&lt;/a&gt; models, make choices about cohabitation or often even yet be considering the kinds of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#contraception&quot; title=&quot;Devices, medications or behaviors used to intentionally aim to prevent pregnancy, including the condom, the cervical barrier, the implant, the patch, the pill, the rhythm method, the ring, the shot, the IUD, spermicide and withdrawal.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;contraception&lt;/a&gt; or even most STIs are a potential issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;re not worried that our content will harm or traumatize younger readers who try and read it (that&#039;s not a thing), we just know much of it won&#039;t fit most of their needs that well. Plus, while seeing just how much content we have on the site can feel like a real boon when you’re a little older, it can feel overwhelming to someone younger, especially someone younger who might get the idea they will need &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; that content in order to manage their sexual life. We’ve always done our best to be in-depth, because sex, sexuality and relationships are complex, but to also make things that ultimately make sex, sexuality and relationships feel &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; manageable for our readers and users: we certainly don’t want to make it seem harder or more complicated than it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;quotecontent&quot;&gt; A few excellent sex ed resources online and off to get started with for the younger set are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amaze.org/&quot;&gt;Amaze and Amaze, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;: a series of videos expressly designed to provide accurate, fun and engaging sex, sexuality and bodies education for pre-teens and very young teens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sex-Funny-Word-Bodies-Feelings/dp/1609806069&quot;&gt;Sex is a Funny Word&lt;/a&gt; by Cory Silverberg and Fiona Smyth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/wait_what_its_finally_here_it_is&quot;&gt;Wait, What? A Comic Book Guide to Relationships, Bodies and Growing Up&lt;/a&gt; by Heather Corinna and Isabella Rotman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uua.org/re/owl&quot;&gt;Our Whole Lives&lt;/a&gt; (OWL) program has curriculum for younger learners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/parents/middle-school/what-should-i-teach-my-middle-schooler-about-sex-and-sex&quot;&gt;This article from Planned Parenthood&lt;/a&gt; about how to talk with pre-teens about sex and sexuality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unhushed.org/info/curricula.php&quot;&gt;Unhushed curricula&lt;/a&gt; for middle school (and more)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But we’ve also always understood, appreciated and empathized with this ask!&lt;/strong&gt; Solid sex ed resources for preteens, particularly those that are also inclusive and sex-positive, are unfortunately still few and far between (but do check out that sidebar there for some good stuff). We want them, too! We’ve also figured that once &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/wait_what_its_finally_here_it_is&quot;&gt;Wait, What?&lt;/a&gt; c&lt;/em&gt;ame out, we might start seeing more users younger than our usual folks at Scarleteen. Lastly, we’ve also wanted some shorter, easier-to-read, more basic pieces for our disability section so we can start to do better when it comes to providing content for those with (or those helping people with) intellectual disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;All of this and more is why we are ultra-mega excited to introduce you to our new section: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/quickies&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quickies!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quickies are condensed, simplified versions of some of our most-read, best-loved content that also will often be a good fit for many somewhat younger users, or those new to sex education. They’re those core pieces of sex education that we think should be available to everybody, if possible. Like everything we do around here, they&#039;re highly inclusive, and don&#039;t uneccessarily or arbitrarily assign &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender&quot; title=&quot;Characteristics that are seen or presented as distinguishing between male and female in a society. Gender may or may not include assigned or chosen: social roles, feelings, behaviors and/or presentation or appearance.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt; or orientation to anything. We&#039;ve carefully created and edited them for lower literacy and to work better for those with intellectual disabilities, too.  (We&#039;re in the middle of working out a tiny hiccup on the index page with advice columns in this section, but expect that to be ironed out shortly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few months, we’ll be rolling out 20 - 30 of these. &lt;strong&gt;Today, we’re debuting with Quickies that cover:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/disability_quickies/quickies_sexual_consent_basics&quot;&gt;consent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/disability_quickies/quickies_sexual_anatomy&quot;&gt;sexual anatomy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/disability_quickies/quickies_periods_and_the_menstrual_cycle&quot;&gt;the menstrual cycle and periods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/disability_quickies/quickies_masturbation&quot;&gt;masturbation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/disability_quickies/quickies_healthy_relationships&quot;&gt;healthy relationships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/disability_quickies/quickies_intimacy&quot;&gt;intimacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/disability_quickies/quickies_crushes&quot;&gt;crushes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/disability_quickies/quickies_pleasure_and_fulfillment&quot;&gt;pleasure and fulfillment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But wait, there&#039;s more!&lt;/strong&gt; Each quickie also has a printable PDF version that fits on one double-sided sheet of paper, attached to the bottom of the page. Like our other content, these are free resources anyone is welcome to use within the basic conditions we mention on them (you use it as-is, including the attribution to us on it, and you don&#039;t use it for profit). We know how many educators -- whether you teach in a school, clinic, shelter, community group or in unschooling/homeschooling environments -- don’t have big (or even any) budgets for sex education materials. We hope having these free resources can help you out. They’re all potentially good for younger  or pre-adolescents, those with learning or other intellectual disabilities, ESL readers or groups where you just want to start with the barest basics of a thing and then branch out on your own from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They might also come in handy if you&#039;re doing general education, caretaking or group leading when any of these issues come up, so you can get a quick start to a bigger discussion. If you want to talk about more ways you can use these or any other part of Scarleteen in the work you do, we&#039;re always happy to help out with that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/contact&quot;&gt;just drop us a line here&lt;/a&gt;. In the event you&#039;ve got a special request for one of our articles you&#039;d love to see made into a quickie, feel free to let us know about that, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;re pretty stoked to get this project started, and we hope you&#039;re as into it as we are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

 <title>Wait, What? It&#039;s Finally Here?!? (It is!)</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/wait_what_its_finally_here_it_is</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It brings a loving, essential lens to matters of heart and soul, offering a roadmap not only to physical changes, but the complex social and emotional terrain of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#consent&quot; title=&quot;To agree to do something or give permission. In the context of sex, a person is giving full consent/is consenting when they freely and actively agree to do something sexual with someone else; however, the person still has the right to change their mind at any point. A person is NOT consenting if they do not actively agree, have been forced or pressured in some way or are in a state where they are incapable of full consent (such as when asleep, under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or below the age of consent).
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;consent&lt;/a&gt;, crushes, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#identity&quot; title=&quot;The defining character or personality of an individual; who we feel like we are as a person. Identity is often used to talk about sexual identity -- who we are as sexual people, which can include things like our sexual orientation, our preferences and things we like and want in sex and sexuality, our sexual politics -- or gender identity, who we feel we are and identify as (even if only to ourselves) in terms of our gender.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;identity&lt;/a&gt;. — Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg, &lt;strong&gt;Nurture the Wow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This dream team of creators came up with a book that is not only accessible but totally enjoyable to read! I’m so excited to see Wait, What? in every library, school and doctor’s office in 2019! — Archie Bongiovanni, &lt;strong&gt;A Quick &amp;amp; Easy Guide to They/Them Pronouns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/wwcover.png&quot; style=&quot;float: right; margin: 10px;&quot; /&gt;Isabella Rotman and I first started dreaming up a comic and activity book for pre-teens and very young teens in the fall of 2014, while Izzy was also working on the first version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isabellarotman.com/not-on-my-watch&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not On My Watch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Around the same time, I got into the thick of the second edition of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/read/all_about_s_e_x_the_scarleteen_book&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;S.E.X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, work I was doing for much of the next year, and Izzy worked on new illustrations for it, too. Then chronic pain and illness I&#039;d long struggled with began to get bad, and soon enough went from bad to worse to some-of-my-spine-literally-crumbling-and-collapsing epic bad. I was first away from the project due to my inability to do much of anything, then for a big surgery and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made our way back to it in 2017, and in fall of 2018, partnered with publisher Oni/Limerence Press, and our editor, Ari Yarwood. We then all worked our tushes off to get it all the way done, which is why today -- AT LONG LAST! SOUND THE TRUMPETS! DOO DO DOO DOOOOOO! -- we can finally present you with &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait, What? A Comic Book Guide to Relationships, Bodies and Growing Up, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;a book we love and loved making very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m so glad that throughout this process, the book has not only been able to keep being all we wanted it to be when we first conceived it, but has become even better than we&#039;d first imagined. I got to make this book with one of my favorite creative collaborators and friends, and we both also got to work with &lt;a href=&quot;https://lukehoward.net/&quot;&gt;Luke Howard&lt;/a&gt;, a great colorist and awesome human, and our team at Oni/Limerence, and now we get to share it with all of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very start of all this, we had in mind making something of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; ed prequel: some of the more foundational, social information and context so often left out of most sex ed, that would give a young person a good start on things no matter what kind of sex and relationships education they got later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;d hoped to do something that could show young people how they could talk well with each other about so much of the tricky stuff that&#039;s happening or showing up in a bigger way for them at this time of life. Things like: changing bodies and relationships, crushes, healthy boundaries, identity, safety, consent, crummy cultural ideas that can really hurt people and mess us all up and how to find and keep -- and themselves give -- good support. I&#039;ve seen young people do this with each other firsthand, and we both wanted to show young people and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#adults&quot; title=&quot;People older than you who probably drive you batty. Or, people whose age in years exceeds the legal age of majority; people considered to be adults by law.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;adults&lt;/a&gt; what it can look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted it to be the kind of book that Izzy and I would actually make as the team we are: something warm and sweet, real and sensitive, open and honest, and fun and full of little things we love, like our pets and our pet peeves, and things we geek out on, like rollerskating, what garbage virginity constructs are, and a certain platypus we just know you&#039;re going to love (I even got to name a character after Sonia Sotomayor!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also very much wanted to be sure to create something that was highly inclusive, which is still sadly hard to find in books about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#puberty&quot; title=&quot;The process of physical and sexual changes from childhood to adulthood, initiated by hormone signals from the brain to the gonads. Puberty usually takes several years to complete -- sometimes even more then five or six -- and changes the brain, bones, muscles, skin, breasts and reproductive organs. &quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;puberty&lt;/a&gt;, sex and relationships. I believe we&#039;ve even been able to release one of the first -- if not the first --- books for this age group that talks about puberty without assigning &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender&quot; title=&quot;Characteristics that are seen or presented as distinguishing between male and female in a society. Gender may or may not include assigned or chosen: social roles, feelings, behaviors and/or presentation or appearance.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt; to bodies or parts, and were able to bring other kinds of inclusion in that are really important to us both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/wwpd1_0.png&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/wwpd2.png&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/wwpd3.png&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;We truly love all our characters -- oh my goodness, &lt;em&gt;sooooo muuuuuch -- &lt;/em&gt;and every section, but I wanted to share one with you as a treat for our debut that we&#039;re both particularly excited about, and not just because it includes you-can-really-cut-them-out paper dolls. But also because of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the way this section &lt;strong&gt;(text and descriptions are at the bottom of the page for those using screen readers)&lt;/strong&gt; talks about and shows &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender_identity&quot; title=&quot;A person&amp;#039;s own sense of whether and in what sense they feel they might be a man, a woman, neither, a mixture of genders, or another gender entirely.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender identity&lt;/a&gt; and expression, and I particularly love the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#relationship&quot; title=&quot;Some kind of ongoing interaction or association with another person, place or thing.

There are all kinds of relationships: family relationships, friendships, romantic relationships, and sexual relationships. Sometimes there is an overlap where we have more than one kind of relationship with someone. Sometimes people use the word relationship to only mean a romantic, &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot;, or committed relationship, even though that&amp;#039;s not all this word means.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;relationship&lt;/a&gt; between Max and Yoshimi: you can tell how Max&#039;s sister probably had and has a whole lot to do with how confident and safe Max feels in &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; identity, and how Yoshimi&#039;s big sister energy is very clearly appreciated and felt by all the friends (a thing we suspect some of the younger siblings of Scarleteen readers may also experience).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like every other section of the book, too, but I don&#039;t want to give it all away (I do, actually, but I know I&#039;m not supposed to)!  So, here&#039;s more of the scoop on the book as a whole, and some places to order it online if you don&#039;t have access to a copy yet at the library or can&#039;t get to a bookstore in person who&#039;s got it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you&#039;ll love it as much as we do, but what we hope even more is that you&#039;ll give it to a young person in your life and that &lt;em&gt;they&#039;ll&lt;/em&gt; love it as much as we do, and maybe even just a little more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Wait-What/Heather-Corinna/9781620106594&quot;&gt;From our publisher&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; From Heather Corinna, founder and director of &lt;i&gt;Scarleteen.com&lt;/i&gt;, and Isabella Rotman, cartoonist and sex educator, comes a graphic novel guide that covers essential topics for preteens and young teens about their changing bodies and feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friends Malia, Rico, Max, Sam and Alexis talk about all the weird and exciting parts of growing up! Using comics, activities and examples, they give encouragement and context for new and confusing feelings and experiences. This supportive group of friends are guides for some tricky subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inclusive of different genders, sexualities, and other kinds of identity, &lt;em&gt;Wait, What? &lt;/em&gt;covers important topics like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bodies, including puberty, body parts and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#body_image&quot; title=&quot;Our sense, awareness and perception of our body in appearance and function as it relates to our sense of self.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;body image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sexual and gender identity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gender roles and stereotypes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crushes, relationships, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual&quot; title=&quot;About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; feelings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boundaries and consent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The media and cultural messages, specifically around bodies and sex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to be sensitive, kind, accepting, and mature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where to look for more information, support and help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fun and easy-to-read guide from expert sex educators that gives readers a good basis and an age-appropriate start with sex, bodies and relationships education. The perfect complement to any school curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A wonderful guide to topics adolescents are curious about, presenting information in relatable, gender-inclusive text and clever illustrations. This is the book adolescents—and their parents—have been looking for. — Melanie Davis, PhD, CSE, &lt;strong&gt;Our Whole Lives Program Associate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Groundbreaking sexuality educator Corinna, founder of the website Scarleteen, works with cartoonist Rotman to bring her knowledge and experience to this slim but mighty guide…This book consistently puts the needs of its readers first, meticulously working to emphasize gender diversity, individuality, and the messiness of adolescence….Body parts are intentionally ungendered, sexual orientations are shown as fluid and joyful, and there is a constant emphasis on the importance of friendships and mutual support. While brief, this guide manages to cover crucial topics thoroughly and humorously, reassuring readers that while all of this is a big deal, it’s something they can handle. The cartoony illustrations are appealing and fun, the book includes interactive activities such as word searches and crossword puzzles, and there’s a fairly thorough glossary in the back. This extremely modern guide to growing up excels in its field.  – &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/heather-corinna/wait-what/?fbclid=IwAR0Yn_UtZIe1-F4wqp_O7r7wTP1nHwobybtiy2mRdZPhiEzn2RQzqQpdo3M&quot; onclick=&quot;javascript:window.open(&#039;https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/heather-corinna/wait-what/?fbclid=IwAR0Yn_UtZIe1-F4wqp_O7r7wTP1nHwobybtiy2mRdZPhiEzn2RQzqQpdo3M&#039;); return false;&quot;&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wait, What? is straightforward and clear, exactly what’s needed to help kids develop authentic awareness and conversation about bodies, relationships, feelings and sexuality. — Peggy Orenstein, &lt;strong&gt;Girls &amp;amp; Sex: Navigating the Complicated New Landscape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can get it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text and description of featured pages:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Paper dolls of Max, includes jeans, roller skates, jacket, engineer boots, Weird Platypus t-shirt, bandana, button-down, witch hat, powdered wig and a dress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Max:&lt;/em&gt; Everyone should be able to wear what they like and feel comfortable in, whatever their gender.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(at bottom of the page) * Gender is basically our own internal sense — not what anyone else thinks or says about it, but how we feel — of being a girl, a boy, both or neither, and the unique ways we feel like or express those feelings. For more definitions of terms we use in this book, check out the glossary in the back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;em&gt;Max’s sister, Yoshimi, reaching into the last frame to take a dress back from Max: &lt;/em&gt;You know it’s not okay to take my stuff without asking me first, Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max: Sibling fail! Sorry, Yoshimi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yoshimi, holding up the dress:&lt;/em&gt; Max always takes this when they want to show their “girly side.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yoshimi: &lt;/em&gt;For some people, gender feels like it does for Max. Some parts of them feel girl-like. Some parts feel boy-like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other people go back and forth, or feel like both at the same time. Some don’t feel like either. Some people don’t relate to or feel masculinity or femininity at all. Other people always and only feel like boys or men, or like girls or women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t feel like I have a “boy-side” or like I have “sides” at all. All my sides feel girly.  There’s nothing right or wrong about how Max experiences gender, how I do, or how girls like Malia or Alexis do. All those ways are right ways, because they all feel right to each of us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yoshimi, popping &quot;It&#039;s a Boy&quot; and &quot;It&#039;s a Girl!&quot; balloons with a pin:&lt;/em&gt; There’s nothing more right or real about how Alexis and Malia are girls than how I am just because when they were born a doctor said they were girls, and when I was born, a doctor said I was a boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yoshimi, arm in arm with Alexia and Malia:&lt;/em&gt; Trans girls like me — whose sense of gender isn’t the same as the sex a doctor said I was when I was born, that&#039;s all — are just as real as girls like Alexis and Malia. That&#039;s also true about trans boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yoshimi, Alexia and Malia, with Max photobombing in front:&lt;/em&gt; All three of us are girls because that’s how we all feel and that&#039;s what we all say we are. Max is…well, whoever Max is today, because that’s what they say.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What&#039;s Death Positivity and How Can It Help Us? A Conversation with Sarah Chavez</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/article/bodies_disability_politics_etc/whats_death_positivity_and_how_can_it_help_us_a_conversation</link>

Here&amp;#039;s some talk with The Order of The Good Death&amp;#039;s Sarah Chavez about death positivity -- what it is, what that means, and who it can help --  and how young people can better understand death, can better talk to each other about it and support each another through it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sarah-chavez.com/about&quot;&gt;Sarah Chavez&lt;/a&gt; knows a thing or two about death. She is a prominent voice in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/death-positive&quot;&gt;death positive movement&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to change the way we talk about death – removing fear and taboo and replacing it with an understanding that being curious about, talking about, and experiencing death are all normal parts of life. She is the executive director of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/about&quot;&gt;Order of the Good Death&lt;/a&gt;, an organization aimed at destigmatizing death, fostering healthy conversations about its importance, looking at loss and death through an intersectional lens, and considering how things like race, money, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender_identity&quot; title=&quot;A person&amp;#039;s own sense of whether and in what sense they feel they might be a man, a woman, neither, a mixture of genders, or another gender entirely.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender identity&lt;/a&gt; impact how we experience death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Sarah is also a dear friend of mine. I found her work by way of her friend and colleague &lt;a href=&quot;http://caitlindoughty.com/&quot;&gt;Caitlin Doughty&lt;/a&gt; – author, funeral home director, and host of the YouTube series, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi5iiEyLwSLvlqnMi02u5gQ&quot;&gt;Ask A Mortician&lt;/a&gt;. As a formerly death-phobic child, Caitlin’s channel opened up a whole new world for me; one where this looming and terrifying experience of dying was demystified. As I ventured further into the world of death positivity, I met Sarah, and began incorporating death positivity into both my work and my life – writing about it for Sarah’s website &lt;a href=&quot;https://deadmaidens.com/category/caroline-reilly/&quot;&gt;Death &amp;amp; the Maiden&lt;/a&gt;, which examines death through a feminist lens, and by opening up conversations with my friends and loved ones about death, death care, and the macabre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;One of the many things I admire about Sarah is her ability to take her work and tailor it to the needs of a specific community. She is passionate about ensuring everyone – regardless of their gender identity, immigration status, location, financial status, race, or disability – can have empowering conversations about death. Be it the current news cycle, or your personal life, we are living in a time where death and loss are everywhere we look: at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/fourth-migrant-in-two-years-dies-after-stay-in-private-immigration-detention-center&quot;&gt;border&lt;/a&gt;, during &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/08/us/school-shootings-us-2019-trnd/index.html&quot;&gt;school shootings&lt;/a&gt;, and in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/krystieyandoli/13-reasons-why-suicide-mom-daughter-netflix-cut-scene&quot;&gt;television shows&lt;/a&gt; (content note on that link: suicide) for example. With this in mind, I wanted to talk with Sarah about how young people could better understand death, how they could better talk to each other about it and support one another through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you explain what death positivity is? What does it mean to you? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Simply put, it is acknowledging that death is a normal part of life, and that engaging with death demonstrates a natural curiosity about the human condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What made you so passionate about death positivity, and death care? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;So many things, but primarily because for me, death positivity is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#social_justice&quot; title=&quot;An equitable distribution of advantages, assets, and benefits among all members of a society.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;social justice&lt;/a&gt; issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;There&#039;s this theory called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=60&amp;amp;v=Joalg73L_gw&quot;&gt;Terror Management Theory&lt;/a&gt; (TMT): it suggests that all of our actions are potentially motivated by the fact that we are aware of our inevitable deaths. Death is scary!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;The anxiety surrounding the fact that we will cease to exist is what motivates all of our actions, largely in an effort to create a legacy – something important that will live on after we are dead, like having kids, or through our work or accomplishments. We also seek out things that make us feel important, superior, or part of something bigger than ourselves, ideas that give us a sense of identity, belonging, and meaning because being a part of something makes us feel good. However, this can have dark side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;Frequent reminders of death – which we’ve been getting a lot of through constant exposure on social media to coverage of mass shootings, police brutality, reports of violent deaths, etc. – these bring up all our fears of death. When this happens, studies have shown that people become fearful and act aggressively toward others who are not like them – people who don’t share the same cultural or national background, religious or political beliefs, even petty things like likes and dislikes. Then when that anxiety about death kicks in, people tend to double down on their fears and beliefs, and in a desperate attempt to preserve their self-esteem/worth, they can end up hating or fearing those who are not like them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;Being more self-aware of our fear of death can help us make better decisions, take personal responsibility for our behavior, and evaluate why we might hold some of our beliefs or values. This can help us to make fact-based, not fear based, decisions and hopefully be kinder to ourselves and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you talk a little bit about the similarities between death taboo and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; taboo — and how they hinder our ability to have honest, healthy conversations about these issues? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Death positivity is similar to sex positivity – both are subjects that are natural human experiences and are integral to our lives, yet our society treats them as taboos, often shaming or stigmatizing discussions about sex and death. Because these are subjects we don’t talk about there’s a lot of misinformation and fear, which lead to unhealthy relationships with our sexuality and our mortality. By being open, curious, and educating ourselves about sex and death we can live and die better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Another important parallel between sex positivity and death positivity has to do with choice, bodily &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#autonomy&quot; title=&quot;The state or condition of being independent and/or having the right to independence.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;autonomy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#consent&quot; title=&quot;To agree to do something or give permission. In the context of sex, a person is giving full consent/is consenting when they freely and actively agree to do something sexual with someone else; however, the person still has the right to change their mind at any point. A person is NOT consenting if they do not actively agree, have been forced or pressured in some way or are in a state where they are incapable of full consent (such as when asleep, under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or below the age of consent).
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;consent&lt;/a&gt;. Part of being death positive is respecting and honoring other people’s choices about their bodies at the end of life and in death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What advice would you have for a young person on how to talk about death and dying without shame or stigma? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Death has been the subject of countless songs, poems, books, art, movies, games, etc. for centuries and across every culture. It is a fascinating subject! How can you not be curious and fascinated about this profound and mysterious life event that will impact you and everyone you know? That doesn’t mean it isn’t scary and painful, and confusing and awkward – it is, but isn’t that even more of a reason to talk and learn about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Not judging other cultures, religions, death rituals, or beliefs and asking questions is important, as well as admitting your own fears. I work with death every day and even I have terrible death anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Remember that death informs how we want to live – because our time is limited, it’s a valuable resource that can help us identify the things and people that mean the most to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you talk about how death positivity intersects with forms of marginalization? How does privilege affect access to proper death care — especially in ways we might not automatically think about?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;A lot of people like to say &lt;i&gt;“We’re all equal in death” &lt;/i&gt;but we aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;The fact is, some bodies, often ones from marginalized communities, are placed closer to experiencing bad or preventable deaths than others. There are many individuals and communities whose ability to access care and choices are limited, and the systems in place often discriminate or are not as accessible to others based on gender, sexuality, race and class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Here are a few specific examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;The life expectancy of a Black trans woman is between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVrrGkl_B-g&quot;&gt;30 and 35 years old&lt;/a&gt;. This is horrific and absolutely unacceptable. In contrast, the life expectancy of a white male in America is mid-late 70s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;People in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#LGBTQ&quot; title=&quot;L = lesbian, G = gay, B = bisexual, T = transgender, Q = queer or questioning. Additional letters sometimes added include U = unsure, I = intersex, P = pansexual, A= asexual, S = straight allies.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;LGBTQ&lt;/a&gt; community are at greater risk of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.advocate.com/health/2013/12/27/end-life-care-aging-lgbt-population&quot;&gt;abuse at the end of life&lt;/a&gt;, which can lead to a myriad of problems, including premature mortality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Trans and nonbinary people can be vulnerable to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/dying-trans-preserving-identity-death&quot;&gt;misgendering and deadnaming&lt;/a&gt; in death if their families do not accept them for their true selves. Without a document called an &lt;a href=&quot;https://coalitionccc.org/2015/06/advance-care-planning-and-the-lgbt-community/&quot;&gt;advance directive&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to legally designate someone to carry out your end of life and death wishes, control of your body automatically reverts to next of kin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/77421/WHO_RHR_12.38_eng.pdf?sequence=1&quot;&gt;Femicide&lt;/a&gt;, the intentional killing of a woman-identified individual who is killed for their gender, is at epidemic proportions, and home, which should be a site of safety and refuge &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/5463069/home-most-dangerous-gender-violence-study-un/&quot;&gt;is the most dangerous place&lt;/a&gt; for women. For &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.niwrc.org/resource-topic/missing-and-murdered-native-women&quot;&gt;indigenous women&lt;/a&gt;, the threat of death is even greater.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;In the United States Black women are dying in childbirth at nearly four times the rate of White women. As for Black infants? They’re dying at about twice the rate of white infants. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.essence.com/amp/culture/racism-is-the-root-sustaining-cause-of-black-infant-mortality/?__twitter_impression=true&quot;&gt;Racism is fueling these deaths&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;Reproductive justice and death are also intertwined. It has been argued that the anti-choice movement manipulates our &lt;a href=&quot;https://deadmaidens.com/2017/01/09/on-death-patriarchy-the-anti-choice-movement/&quot;&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt; of and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/talking-about-abortion/and-the-taboo-of-death-column-Pope-2&quot;&gt;unwillingness to talk&lt;/a&gt; about death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;I know we’re talking about death a lot here, but for me, the core of the death positive movement is about improving the quality of &lt;i&gt;all &lt;/i&gt;our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;I’ve been thinking a lot about how school shootings are forcing young people to confront death and how we can help them develop the tools to cope in this political landscape — especially as so many of them are using their voices to mobilize for change, like the students of Parkland. What would you tell young people who are affected by this kind of mass violence — even those who see it on the news and are afraid it might happen to them? And what advice would you have on balancing self-care and coping with being an advocate on behalf of your peers?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;First of all, I would say I’m sorry. I’m sorry that you have to experience this, and that this is your reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Listen and believe each other’s experiences and fears. It is important that we validate those fears and not brush them off with “Chances are, that won’t happen.” Terrible things &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; happen and in order to change them we need to acknowledge this fact and talk about solutions – this is especially important for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#adults&quot; title=&quot;People older than you who probably drive you batty. Or, people whose age in years exceeds the legal age of majority; people considered to be adults by law.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;adults&lt;/a&gt; to hear. Although I think it is admirable that so many teens are speaking up and becoming advocates for change, young people should not be the ones who carry the burden of enacting that change - but for some, being an active part of a solution can be really beneficial and help feel like you have some control in a situation that often feels like you have none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;We need to create and “hold” space for our own and others’ fears and grief surrounding tragedies, or anything we feel grief over like a breakup, disappointments, etc. That means listening, being consciously present with that person, withholding judgement, not offering advice unless asked, and not trying to fix them or cheer them up. It is fine to say “This sucks, and I don’t know what to say or do, but I’m here for you.” Just know that being there is what’s important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Don’t forget to validate your own feelings! It is normal and reasonable to be scared, hurt, and angry – you are allowed to NOT be ok. It is also fine to want to escape – go for a walk, binge a series, read a book, hang out with your cat, text your friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What advice would you have for a young person who’s recently lost a loved one? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;First, I hope you are being supported in your grief, but I also know that often that’s not the case. Find a death buddy – a trusted person you can safely share your fears, curiosity and grief with. Aisha Adkins has some suggestions on finding the right person in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/everyone-deserves-a-death-buddy-the-value-of-death-positive-friendships&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Anger, depression, and confusion are all part of grief. Know that contrary to what you may have heard, there &lt;i&gt;are no&lt;/i&gt; rules or stages to grief. Just like love, our feelings don’t dissipate when someone dies. We continue to love them and miss them and reach for them. Grief is evidence of love and just like the love you have for them will always stay with you, so will some aspect of grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Something that really surprised me is how deeply &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bustle.com/articles/125917-5-things-that-happen-to-your-body-when-you-lose-someone-close-to-you&quot;&gt;grief impacts&lt;/a&gt; your physical body and your mental capacity and that the symptoms can last for years. People can experience everything from insomnia, inability to focus, and have difficulty remembering things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How can young people support each other through death and grieving? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Be present, acknowledge and bear witness to that pain, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;amp;v=l2zLCCRT-nE&quot;&gt;don’t try to “fix ”&lt;/a&gt; the person or make things “right,” because you can’t. I know this all sounds hard, because it is – it’s hard to watch someone you care about be in pain. Don’t be afraid of saying the “wrong” thing or about being awkward. As a society that avoids death and grief we just haven’t been taught these skills but you &lt;i&gt;can &lt;/i&gt;learn them. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.refugeingrief.com/2018/08/24/itsoktobeawkward/?fbclid=IwAR3sYzIIyzOC_SzE5n55XJP64aLbe0T4iXysoLkoqCzlsW3tyJteXnzzcwQ&quot;&gt;Here’s&lt;/a&gt; a great place to start!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What advice would you have for a young person who is interested in death care but doesn’t know where to start? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;The YouTube series &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi5iiEyLwSLvlqnMi02u5gQ&quot;&gt;Ask a Mortician&lt;/a&gt; is great and covers a lot of ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Look to your community. A lot of the information that is out there on death, dying, and grief centers cis, white, Christian experiences. If you are one of the millions of people that do not identify this way, it can be challenging to find information that supports you or reflects your experience. Many communities have information, workshops, or gatherings that address the needs of their specific communities. If there’s something you’re really passionate about you can get involved – hospice volunteering, at your local cemetery, or protests and vigils are good places to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How can thinking differently about death help us think differently about our bodies in general? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Two main things. First, taking control and making conscious decisions about what happens to your body when you die is an extension of being body positive, and if you have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#femme&quot; title=&quot;Describes a person who is intentionally feminine in appearance, behavior, dress, identity or sexual attitude. Often used in relation to butch. Most often used in the LGBT community, but can refer to people of any orientation.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;femme&lt;/a&gt; body, it’s also a feminist act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;We’ve had our bodies subjected to standards, rules, and laws created by men our entire lives and we often modify our bodies to appeal to the male gaze so we can be “valued” in the patriarchal society we exist in. You can ensure that your death reflects the things that are important to you in life – environmental justice, feminism, anti-capitalism, decolonized rituals, your religious beliefs – whatever you choose, let that final act be one you decide, don’t just give that control away. I am passionate about everyone being empowered to make decisions regarding their bodies in life, and believe those rights should also extend to the body in death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Second, as a person who lives with disabilities it has been hard not to be angry and resentful about the ways my body is different and the things I miss out on. What has helped me is remembering that my body connects me to my ancestors who contributed to the unique individual that I am. So, when I care for my own body, I also feel like I am caring for them. In a small way, gestures of self-care like eating well, resting, preparing myself when I know a stressful event is coming up, all work toward healing physical and emotional traumas of my ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;

&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;consent&lt;/a&gt; is an active, mutual process of negotiating if and how we are (or aren’t) going to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual&quot; title=&quot;About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; with each other. Sexual consent is about everyone having and making real choices. Consent is a shared responsibility. &lt;strong&gt;Everyone needs to ask for consent when they want to do something. No one should have anything done to or with them without their consent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Someone who is freely choosing to say yes to something that they understand and want to do is giving consent. If someone is saying no, isn’t giving a clear yes, or isn’t even asked, they are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; giving consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;Consent is usually easiest to do well with words, where we use language in a form everyone involved can understand to ask each other for permission before we do anything sexual. There are other ways than words, like eye contact or other body gestures. But they’re much trickier. When those ways work well, it’s usually because the people involved already use words for consent and have had lots of practice communicating with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;When we’re seeking consent, we ask questions like&lt;/b&gt;: “Can I kiss you?” Or, “Do you like it when I hold you tightly? Is it okay if I do?” Or, “I want to do something sexual with you: do you want to do something sexual with me? What do you like and want to try?” Or, “I’d like to try &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#oral_sex&quot; title=&quot;Use of the mouth, lips or tongue for sexual stimulation. Cunnilingus (&amp;quot;going down on&amp;quot;), fellatio (&amp;quot;blowjobs&amp;quot;) and analingus (&amp;quot;rimming&amp;quot;) are some common kinds of oral sex.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;oral sex&lt;/a&gt;. Is that something you want to try, too?” Consent should be specific. Everyone should be deciding what exactly they will do together (not just “whatever”) and when, where, and how. For example, giving specific consent to someone asking to be naked with you might sound like, “Yes, but I still need you to ask if you can touch me, and I’ll probably say no, because I’m not sure I’m ready for that. I’m also shy about this, so please be sensitive to that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;Consent isn’t something we only give once. We should always be checking in with each other during sexual activities as we go. We should make sure our partners want to be doing what we’re doing, and that they are okay with the way we’re doing it. Sometimes people still want to do something but want or need to change how they’re doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;If someone consents to one thing, that doesn’t mean they consent to everything. Consent can also ALWAYS be withdrawn. Even if someone says yes to something once, they’re always allowed to change their mind and say no later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;For something to be consensual, there can’t be any force, coercion or manipulation&lt;/b&gt;. Talking or tricking someone into something is coercion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Full consent to sexual things just isn’t possible in some situations. If someone is drunk or high, asleep, very upset, sick, grieving or scared, or is unable to fully understand what’s being asked of them they cannot fully consent. People also need to be able to understand the possible risks or consequences that can be part of what they’re being asked to do in order to consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p7&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;A lack of no is not yes&lt;/b&gt;. Doing consent right means we ask each other questions. If we don’t ask, and no one says anything, that doesn’t mean there was consent. If we ask and the other person doesn’t respond or doesn’t clearly tell us yes, that also isn’t consent. We should only move forward with anything we do to or with someone else if they are clearly telling us yes. If we’re ever not sure, we should ask. If someone says yes, but doesn’t &lt;i&gt;look&lt;/i&gt; like they really want to say yes, we should check in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p7&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nothing makes consent a given or automatic&lt;/b&gt;. Being someone’s spouse, boyfriend or girlfriend doesn’t give anyone consent. Someone loving you or saying they love you doesn’t mean they have your sexual consent, or that you have theirs. No one kind of sex means consent to another. No one is ever “owed” sex. Because someone has had any kind of sex in the past does not mean they will or must consent to sex again with that same person or anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;p9&quot;&gt;One way to think about consent is compare it to a stoplight, the way Columbia University Health Service’s Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Program did:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p10&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Red Light: Signs You Should Stop&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p11&quot;&gt;You or a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#partner&quot; title=&quot;In a sexual context, a person with whom someone is having some kind of sex. The term &amp;quot;partner&amp;quot; can be used for all kinds of relationships, not just serious ones. &amp;quot;Partner&amp;quot; can also mean the person someone is with in a romantic or familial partnership.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;partner&lt;/a&gt; are too intoxicated to gauge or give consent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p11&quot;&gt;Your partner is asleep or passed out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p11&quot;&gt;You hope your partner will say nothing and go with the flow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p11&quot;&gt;You intend to have sex by any means necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p10&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yellow Light: Signs You Should Pause and Talk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p11&quot;&gt;You are not sure what the other person wants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p11&quot;&gt;You feel like you are getting mixed signals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p11&quot;&gt;You have not talked about what you want to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p11&quot;&gt;You assume that you will do the same thing as before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p11&quot;&gt;Your partner stops or is not responsive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p10&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Green Light: Go, but Keep Communicating&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p12&quot;&gt;Partners come to a mutual decision about how far they want to go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p12&quot;&gt;Partners clearly express their comfort with the situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p12&quot;&gt;You feel comfortable and safe stopping at any time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p12&quot;&gt;Partners are excited!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p7&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nonconsent means STOP&lt;/b&gt;: If someone does not give consent or says no, the other person MUST not do that thing. If they are already doing something a person says no to, they must stop, immediately. If they do not stop or exert emotional or other pressure so that person gives in, they are abusing or assaulting that person.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Quickies: Intimacy</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/article/disability_quickies/quickies_intimacy</link>

When we’re being intimate with someone, we’re letting them, or they’re letting us, get closer. We do this by inviting each other into vulnerable or private parts of ourselves. These are places we don’t share with just anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;We can experience intimacy with someone we’ve known all our lives, or with someone we just met. Two people &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; experience intimacy together, but so can three, four, five, ten, twenty or two hundred. People in support groups, jam sessions, families, poly relationships, intentional communities or group events can also experience or build intimacy. Intimacy can also happen in all kinds of relationships and interactions. We can experience intimacy with friends, family, neighbors, caregivers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#romantic&quot; title=&quot;Of, or relating to, intimate or passionate love or interest.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;romantic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual&quot; title=&quot;About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; partners or someone sitting next to us on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Intimacy can happen in a brief &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#period&quot; title=&quot;The fluid, which contains blood, from the shedding of the uterine lining usually at the end of each fertility cycle. Or, that flow you perhaps may have experienced once while shouting, &amp;quot;Oh thank GAWD!&amp;quot;&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;period&lt;/a&gt; of time and can be built over time and become deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Intimacy requires trust. Intimacy can help us build more trust with each other over time. Whether we can build more intimacy has lot to do with how everyone is behaving, not just one person. We can’t create or build intimacy with someone all by ourselves. Not everyone wants or is ready for intimacy. When sharing, some people behave in ways that make people want to shut down, not open up. This doesn’t support intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;When some people say someone was intimate, they’re talking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;b&gt; Sex &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; one way to be intimate, but sex isn’t the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; way to be intimate.&lt;/b&gt; No one thing, including sex, feels intimate for everyone. What is and isn’t intimate to people is personal and individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/Intimacy-Examples-4.gif&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px 18px; float: left; width: 170px; height: 594px;&quot; /&gt;Some ways of being intimate and building intimacy are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;ul1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Sharing our feelings, including hard or uncomfortable feelings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Sharing our thoughts, dreams, goals or ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Sharing touch, or other ways of being physically close, sexual or not. Just letting someone into our physical space is an intimacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Showing someone a part of ourselves we do not feel proud of or think is awesome. This could be something like a body part or a tricky part of our life history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Letting someone into something we consider a private or sacred experience. This could be something like a hike to our own secretly discovered place or meditating or praying together. It could also be doing things in front of someone else we usually only do alone, like going to the bathroom or dancing in our underpants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Sharing meaningful or valuable things: like a song that makes us cry, a childhood toy, a journal or our lucky socks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Delegating or sharing responsibility, like letting someone care for a beloved pet, or doing a joint project about something you really care about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Showing someone our fumbles, faults or flaws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Asking for intimacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li3&quot;&gt;Working on something broken in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#relationship&quot; title=&quot;Some kind of ongoing interaction or association with another person, place or thing.

There are all kinds of relationships: family relationships, friendships, romantic relationships, and sexual relationships. Sometimes there is an overlap where we have more than one kind of relationship with someone. Sometimes people use the word relationship to only mean a romantic, &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot;, or committed relationship, even though that&amp;#039;s not all this word means.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;relationship&lt;/a&gt;, or talking about our conflicts, fears or doubts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li4&quot;&gt;Helping someone, allowing ourselves to be helped or asking for help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Handle with care&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Don’t forget: when we are being vulnerable together we need to treat each other with extra &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sensitivity&quot; title=&quot;A responsiveness to internal or external stimulus.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, kindness and care. We’re all more fragile when we’re being intimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Intimacy should never be forced&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;b&gt; That isn’t intimacy, that’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#abuse&quot; title=&quot;Purposeful harm or mistreatment of another person, which can be verbal, emotional, physical or sexual. An ongoing pattern or cycle of such mistreatment or harm can characterize an abusive relationship.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;abuse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;When people are intimate with each other in a healthy way, everyone respects any limits and boundaries. There still needs to be room and space to focus on everyone as individuals. Everyone also gets to choose not to be intimate in any way, at any time. Healthy intimacy is consensual. There’s only sharing if, when and how everyone wants to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why would we want to be intimate&lt;/b&gt;?&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Being intimate can increase our ability to be compassionate, sympathetic and empathic. We can learn to be more patient and forgiving of ourselves and others. Intimacy is one of the ways we can learn to love ourselves and others. Intimacy can let us feel free to be our whole selves. We can feel accepted and accept others. It can help us grow and deepen as people and find out more about ourselves and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Healthy intimate relationships can feel like a good home: a place where we and others feel truly safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When some people say someone was intimate, they’re talking about sex.&lt;b&gt; Sex &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; one way to be intimate, but sex isn&#039;t the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; way to be intimate.&lt;/b&gt;  No one thing — including sex — feels intimate for everyone, or for anyone in every interaction or situation. What is and isn’t intimate to people is personal and individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some ways of being intimate and building intimacy are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing our feelings, including hard or uncomfortable feelings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing our thoughts, dreams, goals or ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing touch, or other ways of being physically close; sexual or not.  Just letting someone into our physical space is an intimacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Showing someone a part of ourselves -- like a body part, or a tricky part of our life history -- we do not feel proud of or think is awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Letting someone into something we consider a private or sacred experience, like a hike in our own secretly-discovered place, or meditating or praying together.  Doing something in front of someone else we usually only do alone, like going to the bathroom or dancing in our underpants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing very meaningful or valuable things: like a song that makes  us cry, a childhood toy, a journal or our lucky socks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delegating or sharing responsibility with something valued, like letting someone care for a beloved pet, or doing a joint project about something you really care about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Showing someone our fumbles, faults or flaws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking for intimacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working on something broken in our relationship, or talking about our conflicts, fears or doubts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helping someone, allowing ourselves to be helped ourselves or asking for help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why would we want to be intimate? &lt;/b&gt;Being intimate can increase our ability to be compassionate, sympathetic and empathic;  more patient and forgiving with and of ourselves and others. It’s one of the ways we can learn to love ourselves and others.  Intimacy can let us feel free to be our whole selves.  We can feel accepted and accept of others.  It can help us grow and deepen as people and find out more about ourselves and others than we might otherwise.  Healthy intimate relationships can feel like a good home:  a place where we and others feel truly safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Handle with care: Don’t forget: &lt;/b&gt;when we are being vulnerable together — or when one person is making themselves vulnerable to another — we need to treat each other with extra sensitivity, kindness and care.  We’re all more fragile when we’re being intimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Intimacy should never be forced: that isn’t really intimacy, that’s abuse.  &lt;/b&gt;When people are intimate with each other in a healthy way,  everyone also always has and respects any limits and boundaries.  There still needs to be room and space and focus on everyone as totally separate individuals. Everyone also gets to choose not to be intimate in any way, at any time. Healthy intimacy is consensual: there’s only sharing if, when and how everyone wants to.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Becoming Out: a totally non-exhaustive, step by step guide to coming out</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/article/relationships_sexual_identity_etc/becoming_out_a_totally_nonexhaustive_step_by_step_guide_to</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-author field-type-text field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Liz Duck-Chong&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-introduction field-type-text-long field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;We hope every time you open up to someone about your truth they respond with love and kindness. But we also want to make sure you&amp;#039;re prepared in case they don&amp;#039;t, and give you some practical strategies and tools to look after yourself if that’s what happens. With that in mind, here&amp;#039;s a new, totally non-exhaustive, step by step guide to coming out.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;I think being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#queer&quot; title=&quot;In the context of sexuality, a broad term for sexual orientation that can describe any number of orientations which are not heterosexual. People who identify as queer may be bisexual or pansexual, gay or lesbian, questioning, asexual or more. &quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;queer&lt;/a&gt; is one of the coolest things you can be, even if it doesn’t always feel like it. The amazing people I&#039;ve met and friends I’ve made, the care with which I&#039;ve grown into my mind and body, and the love I&#039;ve learned to show myself, no matter what trials I face, all go to show that being queer can be such a beautiful thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;But while LGBTQIA+ people are more visible and more accepted than ever, we follow in the footsteps of a history of struggle and violence – the statistics are slowly getting better, but any amount of harm is still too much. Nor is the fruit of youth always a peachy time to begin with. Queer, trans and/or gendernonconforming young folk have a unique set of challenges as we figure out who we are and how to let others into our various worlds of words, feelings, and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Sadly, not everyone reacts the way we want them to, and experiencing a rejection of who we &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; is never easy; it can vary from being a bit overwhelming to totally crushing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;I came out to my parents via an (admittedly far too long) email. I didn’t hear anything back for &lt;em&gt;months&lt;/em&gt;. I was convinced that their silence meant the worst, and started making drastic plans for what this meant. I still feel fortunate that it turned out they were just taking that time to research and try to understand, but it was that plan that helped me to feel like I had options in case it really had gone to hell in a handbasket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;We at Scarleteen hope that every time you open up to someone about your truth they respond with love and kindness. But we also want to make sure you&#039;re prepared in case they don&#039;t and give you some practical strategies and tools to look after yourself if that’s what happens. It can hurt a lot when people we love and look up to or rely upon let us down, for a whole range of reasons, but you are not alone, and you can get through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;We can’t always choose the ways we come out to the people around us, but with some preparation and planning we can have a little bit more control over how this might go. With this in mind, we&#039;ve put this guide together for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. It takes (at least) two: WHO &amp;amp; WHY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;How you’ll go about coming out probably looks different if it’s your best friend or your parents, a group of friends you game with online, a teacher or college professor, or a coworker. (You might want to be able to tell your best friend all the squee-inducing details about the new crush you’ve got, but your parents or professors may get a much more restrained version!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Once we’ve identified who we want to talk to, we can then consider what we want to tell them, and why we’re telling them now. It’s okay to come out &lt;b&gt;at any time&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;for any reason&lt;/b&gt;, including “Because I want to.” But knowing the specific reasons you want to do it can help you unpack your needs and expectations, and help you identify and what kind of support you might need from others afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;ul1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;Do you want to just have them know, no matter what they think or what their reaction is?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;Are you trying to let them in to your life so you can be closer—in which case considering their reactions might be a big part of it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;Maybe you think or know they’re also queer and want to relate to them about your shared queerness!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;Are you going to college or moving away soon?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;Have you decided that you just don’t want to hide it anymore?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;All of these are good reasons to want to share this part of yourself with others, but knowing which can be really useful for managing our wants, needs and expectations throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. PLANNING THE CONVERSATION: HOW, WHERE &amp;amp; WHEN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Coming out is never a one-time deal. We do it all the time throughout our lives: to new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#romantic&quot; title=&quot;Of, or relating to, intimate or passionate love or interest.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;romantic&lt;/a&gt; interests, family members, new friends and colleagues, or the guy working at the cinema when you’re seen holding hands on cheap Tuesday. Coming out can become easier over time, but the first few times can be a bit scary and confusing. And we may never stop worrying about how people might react to us! Having a plan can go a long way towards mitigating those anxieties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;No matter what your situation is, it can be a really good idea to have a support plan in place. It’s okay to ask others for support when you need it; needing support isn’t a sign of failure or weakness, but an acknowledgement you, like everyone, deserve care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;Having someone with you for support can be a big help. For example, when coming out to someone it can sometimes be helpful to have a friend or family member in the room with you, or hanging out in the next room while you have the conversation at the kitchen table so you’ve got someone nearby. If you’re coming out to your family, having a sibling, a cousin, or another adult in your extended family you can turn to, can do a world of good for both the difficult conversations, and for feeling like you’re not completely alone. At the very least, having another person around helps people think about how they’re responding and behaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First: &lt;strong&gt;how do you want to come out to someone?&lt;/strong&gt; You may want to do it in person, face to face, in a letter or email, or maybe over the phone or on Skype—whether you’re not close enough to chat in person or if you’d just prefer a bit of physical distance. &lt;div class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;quotecontent&quot;&gt;In some situations it can be helpful to hear the other person’s opinion. Brittney McNamara writes for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teenvogue.com/story/how-to-handle-parent-rejection-after-coming-out&quot;&gt;Teen Vogue&lt;/a&gt; that, &quot;As hard as it might be to listen to your parent&#039;s perspective on things, it will help in terms of finding a way to get through to your parent about what you actually need and helping them understand in their own language about what your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#identity&quot; title=&quot;The defining character or personality of an individual; who we feel like we are as a person. Identity is often used to talk about sexual identity -- who we are as sexual people, which can include things like our sexual orientation, our preferences and things we like and want in sex and sexuality, our sexual politics -- or gender identity, who we feel we are and identify as (even if only to ourselves) in terms of our gender.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;identity&lt;/a&gt; means to you.&quot; For example, many parents fear that being queer will make our lives more difficult and react strongly out of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#desire&quot; title=&quot;A feeling of strongly wanting something. In the context of sex, desire can be a strong feeling of a physical and psychological want for any kind of sex.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;desire&lt;/a&gt; to protect or care for us, and if we find that out, we can talk to them about what we know can help us with that, like having their support. But it’s also valid to take your time before you’re ready to hear someone else’s feelings, especially if they’re not listening to yours.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re planning on coming out in person, consider where you feel safe. Do you always have important conversations with your parents in your family living room? Does being in public, e.g., at a restaurant or park, feel safer? A neutral ground, like the house of another family member or friend who already knows, or in a car while on a drive, can also be a good space to have these conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;It’s important, too, to figure out what your limits are. Part of this plan could look like when you sit quietly, when you push back against rejection, when you open up, and when the conversation is over. Do you want to take the time to sit with them and talk them through it? Will it be better and healthier for you to give them the basics and not be there for the potential fallout? You are allowed to keep trying with someone, you are allowed to ask for more, and you are also alwaysb allowed to leave and not tell them why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considering &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; to come out is also important&lt;/strong&gt;. Talking at the end of a long day might mean people have less energy to soften negative reactions or might be quicker to express hurtful emotions. Of course, sometimes it just comes out of nowhere: suddenly you’ve blurted out that you really like a girl at school, or that you really aren’t happy in your body the way it is right now, and it can feel like you’ve sucked all the air out of the room. Don’t panic! Taking time to think about this now can help in those moments, even if it seems to come out of nowhere; you’ve got this.So you’ve thought about the who, how, the where and the when, but what are the actual words you’re going to say, and how are you going to say them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. PLANNING THE CONVERSATION: WHAT TO SAY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Public speaking often tops the lists of people’s biggest fears. It totally makes sense, then, that having difficult conversations also does! But with a bit of planning and practice you 100% have it in you to come out and convey your wants, needs, and hopes to others. Think about how you might start the conversation, what wording you’ll use, or how you’ll answer questions asked of you: that’s a great start to feeling more in control of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use your past experience.&lt;/b&gt; A good way to think about this is to consider any times in the past you’ve come out, whether about the same aspect of your life you’re considering now, or another thing entirely. Thinking about those experiences, how did they go? Were you talking to the same people you’re wanting to talk to now, or different people? How did they react? Were there particular ways you phrased things? Did bringing it up one way feel more comfortable than another, or did you try something and it felt really bad instead? What would you want to do differently this time than in the past, and how could you do so? Now’s the time to consider what that different looks like and how to make it happen this time around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you want to say? &lt;/b&gt;When figuring out what to say, remember that only you know the truth you’re living. Using “I feel” statements is one way of expressing this: &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; are the expert on you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p7&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Practice first. &lt;/b&gt;Whether or not you’ve come out before, how does it go when you imagine doing so in your head? Preparing what you want to say is a really good way to do this—practice to a friend, a counsellor, or even a mirror. Brainstorm some phrases that you can remember and have handy in case things aren’t going well, or you feel flustered, such as “I’m not going to apologize for the way I am”, “I’m sorry you feel that way, but that doesn’t change what I’m letting you know” or “I’m not asking for your permission, I’m asking for your acceptance”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it on before you send it out.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re going to send an email or a text, write a draft before you send it. Share it with a friend or try reading it out loud to yourself to see how it sounds. You can try this even if you’re planning on having this conversation in person. When you eventually do send it, you can put in something like an email tracker (&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/email-tracker/bnompdfnhdbgdaoanapncknhmckenfog?hl=en&quot;&gt;here’s one for Gmail&lt;/a&gt;) to see if someone’s opened the email or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plan to be at your best. &lt;/b&gt;While also thinking about what to say, it’s critical to make sure you’re in a good position to say it. Make sure you’re sleeping enough, eating well, and checking in with the people who support you. If the stress is overwhelming, practicing some &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.bulletproof.com/deep-breathing-exercises/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;breathing exercises&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can help you feel more calm in your body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;You’ve done lots of preparation by now, maybe feeling pumped to get through this, or scared about what could happen. All of these feelings are okay, and totally normal right now! So how do we go about the big conversation itself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. GET READY, ‘CAUSE HERE I COME (OUT)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;You’re here, you’re (trans, otherwise &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender&quot; title=&quot;Characteristics that are seen or presented as distinguishing between male and female in a society. Gender may or may not include assigned or chosen: social roles, feelings, behaviors and/or presentation or appearance.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt;-nonconforming and/or) queer, and this conversation’s drawing near!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before coming out to someone, have a think about the following questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;What do you &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to happen in this conversation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;What are you &lt;i&gt;afraid&lt;/i&gt; will happen?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Are those desires or fears realistic, or are they outlandish?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;What do you &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; to happen? To be heard, understood, or accepted?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Being aware of your hopes and your fears can help you prepare for whatever happens and what you’ll do afterwards. If you’re not sure you’ll get what you need, you don’t have to come out. There will be another time. You will meet people who are proud of you and are thankful you’ve come out to them, even if it’s not the people you want to come out to today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;To be affirmed, seen, and loved by others are among the reasons people come out in the first place, and we all hope that things will go really well. Things might also go badly, which is why coming out is scary, but preparation can help. Whatever happens, you’re allowed to feel whatever comes to you in the moment and after. It’s not easy to be vulnerable with people whose reactions you care about, but no one can take your identity, your language, or how you want to love, live and exist away from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;What might &lt;i&gt;going badly &lt;/i&gt;mean in your situation? Is your safety or your access to your support networks, mental health care, or your housing compromised? Does it mean that people will get angry or upset with you? Even in cases where they are supportive, people, especially family members, can express a range of emotions that’s difficult and uncomfortable for you to hear. But again, keep in mind that whatever feelings &lt;i&gt;they’re&lt;/i&gt; having are not &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; responsibility. You are allowed to remove yourself while they’re doing that processing. You can leave at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? (LET’S TALK OUTCOMES)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;What would you like to happen after you come out? Whether, like me, you have a meticulous bullet-pointed list, or a vague idea is more your style, seeking care afterwards is also super important. Coming out is hard work and deserves rest and reward, no matter what happens. Here are some ideas that might help you calm down, relax, and recharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;First things first:&lt;/b&gt; What’s your plan for immediately after, good or bad? Maybe you’ll go to a great vegan ice cream shop near you and camp out with a book, or meet a friend for coffee, or play a game you can bury your head in for a while and let yourself destress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p7&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affirm yourself:&lt;/strong&gt; I like writing myself a stack of notes full of big queer affirmation that I can read in difficult times. You can ask friends to help, too — little notes and messages and videos can remind you of how loved you are and what you love about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Feel your feelings!&lt;/b&gt;: Giving yourself the space to listen to how you feel and not squash it down is super important. Wanting to be supported and loved for our identities is not unfair or wrong, and neither is feeling disappointed or upset if you’re not shown that love Take some time to experience the emotions that come up, whether they’re anger, sadness, confusion, frustration; Even when things have gone wrong, I hold onto the feeling of being proud of myself for trying, and that’s something that even the worst rejection can’t take away from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Build a team:&lt;/b&gt; Everyone needs one! As we talked about earlier, an essential part of this plan is finding support from others. Your team may include IRL or online friends, a sibling, an extended family member, or a therapist. Reaching out to the people who are in your corner can remind you that you’re not the only one standing up to bat in this sports metaphor. Ask for what you need. This might look like a hug, a couch to crash on, someone to text while it’s going down, or a date to order a pizza and play some video games together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p8&quot;&gt;If you’ve got one, your therapist, counselor, or caseworker can help you set healthy goals and identify the services and support networks in your area. If you don’t have access to a therapist or counselor , there are some amazing anonymous phone, text, and online-chat counselling or support services around the world, including some focused on sexuality and gender. Many of these are even free of charge, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/need_help_now_a_guide_to_scarleteens_direct_services&quot;&gt;services available right here at Scarleteen&lt;/a&gt;. Before you have the conversation (or send the email or the text), make a list of contact details for some local or national support services (eg. hotlines, chat services, drop-in groups). Not only will you have them on hand for yourself, a friend who’s helping you can also have a chance to talk about their feelings when sharing them with you might not be helpful! &lt;em&gt;Them&lt;/em&gt; magazine has a very helpful guide to finding online and offline services &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.them.us/story/how-to-find-a-queer-therapist&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;quotecontent&quot;&gt;Does seeing a therapist mean I’m crazy?&lt;/b&gt; There can be a lot of stigma around talking to a mental health professional about your sexuality or gender, like it makes you seem ‘crazy’ to be doing so, or like there’s something ‘wrong’ with you, but people of all genders, sexualities, bodies and lives see therapists and doctors for a range of reasons. It’s a very normal and healthy thing to do. Mental health professionals are trained to provide you with resources, tools and ideas for managing stress, fear and difficult times! They are legally also required to keep your confidence, unless they believe you are a danger to yourself or others.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finding your spaces: &lt;/b&gt;Where do you find safe spaces? They could include youth groups, an online chat forum, or a volunteer job at a queer-run organization (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/scarleteen_volunteer_application&quot;&gt;ahem&lt;/a&gt;). It might look like helping to code a queer website, running a group for folk who share something in common with you on social media, or so many other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your safety plan:&lt;/b&gt; If stuff goes bad, where do you go from here? What does the next hour, day, week look like, the next month? Knowing what your options are means you’ve got less to be scrambling to do if it happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p8&quot;&gt;Is there somewhere you can go while things cool down, or crash for a night? Maybe you have a friend that can come and pick you up and go for a drive or hang out so that you feel safe even if you’re a bit shaken up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p8&quot;&gt;In a more serious situation, do you have somewhere safe you can stay in the long term? You may want to write down the numbers of any nearby shelters or research details of your state’s rental assistance programs and your local rental market. We don’t want to have to rely on any of this, but sometimes having all your bases covered can help you feel safer entering a scary situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Naming grief:&lt;/b&gt; When things go badly, especially if it means we lose friends, family, and support systems, we can feel very real grief for those losses. It’s okay to sit in that and recognize it as grief and to be sad about it, especially if someone has reacted in a way that’s made you feel uncomfortable, needy, or like you’re causing a fuss. Your response is super valid, no matter what someone else has said to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;If things get difficult, it can be really helpful to remind yourself that you planned for this. There’s a list to follow, people and professionals to get in touch with, and love to receive. Whether it all goes to hell in a hand basket, or you find yourself closer than ever to the people you’ve come out to, you’re going to be okay, no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. WHEN DOES IT GET EASIER? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;As we’ve said, coming out is not something that happens just once. However, the more we do it, and the more support we have around us that we can rely on, the easier it gets. It takes work to get there, but it’s not only possible but eminently achievable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;No matter what happens, remember: you’ve planned for this. You know where your exits are, who’s on your team, and where you can find support, whether it’s from friends, partners, family members, folk on the internet or anyone else you know will be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual&quot; title=&quot;About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; or gender indentities aren&#039;t the only things that define us, so it can be super disappointing when one or both become the thing by which we are defined and judged by others. You are so much more than just your gender or your sexual identity (even though those things are amazing)! Coming out also offers us the opportunity to find people who &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; accept, love and cherish us -- romantic or sexual partners, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#platonic&quot; title=&quot;Something intimate or affectionate but not sexual.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;platonic&lt;/a&gt; friends, chosen family -- and who will see our sexualities and genders as part of the beautiful, shining part in the amazing kaleidoscopic whole that makes up a human being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;In feeling these emotions and having these doubts, you are treading in the footsteps of so many people. &lt;strong&gt;Get ready to embrace the universe of love that is out there.&lt;/strong&gt; Queer, trans and gender-nonconforming people are not going anywhere, and the ashes we keep rising from have forged us into the strong, loud and vibrant communities we are today, communities we are proud and happy to have you as a part of.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sexuality in Color: Euphoria</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/chant%C3%A9_thurmond/sexuality_in_color_euphoria</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/incolor.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: right; width: 234px; height: 166px;&quot; /&gt;If anyone had told me when I was younger that thirty-something Chanté would be binge-watching teenage television dramas in 2019, I sure would have been surprised. But I also wouldn’t have predicted there’d be something to watch like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbo.com/euphoria/season-1/1-pilot&quot;&gt;Euphoria&lt;/a&gt;, HBO’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/06/euphoria-zendaya-hbo-review&quot;&gt;new teen drama&lt;/a&gt; released just in time for summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;The first thing that hit me was the main character, Rue, played by the one and only Zendaya: she reminded me of myself and some of my friends I grew up with back in Iowa. The list of our similarities is longer than our differences. Like me, Rue is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#cisgender&quot; title=&quot;Describes people who have a gender identity which is traditionally thought to “match” their assigned sex. For instance, someone who was assigned male at birth who identifies as a man. Often used in relation to transgender.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;cisgender&lt;/a&gt;, biracial girl being raised in a single-parent household in the middle of white suburbia. She’s also the eldest daughter and a protective big sister with a small chip on her shoulder. Rue’s independent mind and her strongwilled nature remind me most of myself. I relate to her slight defiance, especially as someone who also was very much an independent thinker who often resisted the popular opinions of my high school peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Our subtle differences (like the fact that her father is absent due to him dying, while mine was incapable of taking care of us due to his own substance &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#abuse&quot; title=&quot;Purposeful harm or mistreatment of another person, which can be verbal, emotional, physical or sexual. An ongoing pattern or cycle of such mistreatment or harm can characterize an abusive relationship.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;abuse&lt;/a&gt;) didn’t really get in the way of me relating to Rue’s narrative and those of the rest of the cast. In fact, there were many subnarratives that felt super familiar to me and compelled me to continue watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;I was excited to see what would unfold as Rue shared more of her mixed girl narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/zendaya-euphoria.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: left; width: 500px; height: 290px;&quot; /&gt;I know how important it is for brown and Black young people to see characters who look like them, and I know how much &lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;longed for someone who looked like me and had a not-so-perfect home life to tell the rest of the world what it can actually like to be a biracial teenage girl. When I was seventeen, I craved raw honesty about what it meant to grow up in a place where kids were isolated but also privileged. I also secretly hoped someone would be brave enough to share what it meant to be a little unruly, and how easy it was to be enticed by drugs, alcohol, house parties and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;At the end of the day, I just remember wanting an alternative to the whitewashed narratives that were constantly being rerun on TV. I grew up during an era when shows like “My So-Called Life”, “Saved By The Bell”, “Dawson’s Creek” and “The Real World” were constantly playing in the background. None of those shows were a true depiction of what was really happening in my life. I brushed them off and didn’t really take any of them seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;I recently came across this article — &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/euphoria-and-the-black-girls-coming-of-age_n_5d0145c6e4b0304a1208fa71&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Euphoria And The Black Girl’s Coming Of Age&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — by Zeba Blay: she shared feelings about Euphoria that really resonated with me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The dearth of coming-of-age stories about black girls is heavily predicated on the fact that, so often, black girls aren’t given the space to even be girls. They’re often hyper-sexualized from an early age, and if they take the initiative to be intentional about exploring their sexuality, they’re deemed as “fast.” Unlike white teens, black girls are rarely given room to mess up, to make mistakes, to grow. Rue is a game-changing character in this sense because she is, by her own admission, the ultimate fuck-up. Since the story is told from her point of view, we’re put in a position where we can empathize with her.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rue runs the narrative, indeed. But it’s also powerful that Rue’s story isn’t simply the main story ― the lives of the other characters are also under her control. This storytelling approach further cements her importance, her necessity, her voice.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;That sums up a lot of why I’m so excited about the potential of this series. We &lt;i&gt;finally&lt;/i&gt; have access to a more honest first-person narrative led by someone who doesn’t have blue eyes and blonde hair and who isn’t growing up in a picture-perfect home tucked away in a gated community. While some viewers may not relate to Rue ethnically or racially, there’s a big chance many viewers &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; relate to the realities of growing up in a single-parent household or being a teenager (or having a friend) who’s struggling to overcome addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Every single episode is packed with typical coming-of-age themes: sex, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender&quot; title=&quot;Characteristics that are seen or presented as distinguishing between male and female in a society. Gender may or may not include assigned or chosen: social roles, feelings, behaviors and/or presentation or appearance.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt;, high school drama and gossip, relationships, experimentation with drugs, beauty standards, conflicts with parents and so on. But even these familiar themes don’t feel so predictable in this context. The rawness and the intersectionality of Euphoria seem to have the potential for relating to a wider range of teenagers and young adult viewers. Paired with the rich backstories we were introduced to in this first season, there are plenty of opportunities for this series to exhibit the true diversity of the characters and to explore even very traditional themes in very non-traditional ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;I believe that honest narratives beget honest conversations among young people, which is what we need whenever we’re talking about core parts of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#identity&quot; title=&quot;The defining character or personality of an individual; who we feel like we are as a person. Identity is often used to talk about sexual identity -- who we are as sexual people, which can include things like our sexual orientation, our preferences and things we like and want in sex and sexuality, our sexual politics -- or gender identity, who we feel we are and identify as (even if only to ourselves) in terms of our gender.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;identity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;I think they also allow us to feel more empathy and compassion with our own intersectionalities&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;more importantly, &lt;/i&gt;with&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;those of others, which are usually more difficult to relate to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Hats off to the writers, producers, directors and the cast who&#039;ve done an excellent job so far of showing us it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; possible to capture the tenderness of adolescence while still being honest and making space for its characters to explore, experiment and evolve. I didn’t think it was possible to lure me back to teenage drama, but &lt;i&gt;Euphoria&lt;/i&gt; has proven otherwise. I’m totally a fangirl and am very &lt;em&gt;im&lt;/em&gt;patiently waiting for season two!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;meta  itemprop=&quot;name&quot; content=&quot;Sexuality in Color: Euphoria&quot; id=&quot;md24&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-taxonomy-vocabulary-3 field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/sexuality_in_color&quot;&gt;sexuality in color&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/euphoria&quot;&gt;Euphoria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/media&quot;&gt;media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/television&quot;&gt;television&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/zendaya&quot;&gt;Zendaya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/black&quot;&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/girls&quot;&gt;girls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/control&quot;&gt;control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/coming_of_age&quot;&gt;coming of age&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/realness&quot;&gt;realness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/honesty&quot;&gt;honesty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/young_people&quot;&gt;young people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/teen&quot;&gt;teen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/drama&quot;&gt;drama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/biracial&quot;&gt;biracial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-author field-type-text field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Author:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Chanté Thurmond&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

We can explore and experience our sexuality and pleasure with potentially &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Here are some of the body parts most often involved when people explore sexuality and seek pleasure.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The brain&lt;/b&gt;: The largest, most important and most active &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual&quot; title=&quot;About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; organ of the body isn’t a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#penis&quot; title=&quot;One of the two external reproductive organs of people assigned male at birth.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;penis&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#vagina&quot; title=&quot;The internal passage leading from the opening of the vulva to the cervix of the uterus.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;vagina&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the brain!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sexuality is usually about the body. It’s also just as much about thoughts and feelings. Even in the ways it is physical, we feel those sensations through our central &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#nervous_system&quot; title=&quot;The system of cells, tissues and organs that regulate our body&amp;#039;s responses to internal and external stimuli.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;nervous system&lt;/a&gt;. That’s all brain stuff. Without a brain, we couldn’t experience sexuality or pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain also releases hormones that influence how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; feels. All of our body parts are communicating with the brain during sex. The brain is also primarily responsible for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#orgasm&quot; title=&quot;An event typically in response to physical or intellectual sexual stimulation, controlled by the involuntary nervous system. Orgasm often results in muscle contractions in and around the genitals, other muscular spasms throughout the body, and a feeling of sexual and/or tension release.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;orgasm&lt;/a&gt; and is where orgasm actually happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erogenous zones&lt;/b&gt;: Erogenous zone is a term used to describe a part of the body that usually feels extra sensitive. That’s because it’s got a lot of sensory nerve endings. This can include the lips, tongue, palms and fingers, the bottoms of the feet, the inner thighs, nipples, neck, ears, armpits and the genitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#perianal&quot; title=&quot;Around the anus.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;perianal&lt;/a&gt; region (the butt)&lt;/b&gt;: The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#anus&quot; title=&quot;The external opening to the rectum, located between the buttocks.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;anus&lt;/a&gt; is the opening (to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#rectum&quot; title=&quot;The internal passage between the anus and the colon; stores solid waste until it leaves the body through a bowel movement.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;rectum&lt;/a&gt;, inside the body) that’s visible between your buttocks. It and the rectum can be sites of sexual pleasure for people of any &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender&quot; title=&quot;Characteristics that are seen or presented as distinguishing between male and female in a society. Gender may or may not include assigned or chosen: social roles, feelings, behaviors and/or presentation or appearance.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual_orientation&quot; title=&quot;A term -- like homosexual, heterosexual, bisexual, queer, straight, lesbian, gay, asexual -- used to describe a person&amp;#039;s usual or current pattern of emotional, romantic and/or sexual attraction to other people in terms of gender.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual orientation&lt;/a&gt;. Then there’s the prostate. The prostate is a walnut-sized gland in the body that’s located below the bladder. If you were born with a penis, you were probably born with a prostate. The prostate is very sensitive to pressure and touch. It can be pleasurable to have it stimulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pudendal nerve is also located in this area, at the bottom of the spine. A lot of the feelings people have in their genitals during orgasm and other parts of sexual response are because of the pudendal nerve talking to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pubococcygeus muscle (which some people might call PC or Kegel muscles) is also in this area. It stretches from the pubic bone to the tailbone. It supports the pelvic organs. It usually contracts during orgasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perineal sponge is also in this region for people born with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#vulva&quot; title=&quot;The name for the external genitals of people assigned female at birth. The vulva includes the mons, external clitoris, inner and outer labia, fourchette and perineum.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;vulva&lt;/a&gt; (that&#039;s all the outside portions of the genitals for someone with a vagina). It’s internal to the body, between the bottom of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary%23vaginal_opening&quot;&gt;vaginal opening&lt;/a&gt; and the rectum. It’s part of the clitoral system. It is made of nerve endings, erectile tissue and blood vessels. A person might feel sensations of this sponge from stimulation to the vagina, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#clitoris&quot; title=&quot;A sexual organ both external and internal on the vulva and inside the pelvis of those assigned female at birth that is similar to the penis, but serves no other known purpose besides providing sexual pleasure.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;clitoris&lt;/a&gt; or anus or the areas around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The penis&lt;/b&gt;: Any and all parts of the penis may be enjoyable—or not!—when touched during sex or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#masturbation&quot; title=&quot;Ways that people seek out and/or experience sexual pleasure by themselves, without a sexual partner.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;masturbation&lt;/a&gt;. The head of the penis usually has a higher number of sensory nerves than the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#shaft&quot; title=&quot;On the penis, the portion of the penis extending from below the head to the base of the penis, where it is attached to the body. On the vulva, an internal portion of the clitoris behind and beneath the clitoral glans.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;shaft&lt;/a&gt;. If a person with a penis has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#foreskin&quot; title=&quot;A loose tube of skin with nerve endings that extends from shaft of the penis to below the glans and which normally covers the head of the penis when it is not erect. Those born with penises are also born with a foreskin, but some foreskins are removed (circumcised) in infancy or later in life for any of a variety of different reasons.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;foreskin&lt;/a&gt;, that can also be a source of pleasure. It’s full of sensory nerve endings. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#testes&quot; title=&quot;Reproductive glands of people with penises. They sit outside the body and are contained within the scrotum.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;testes&lt;/a&gt; and scrotum also have many sensory nerve endings. People can find sexual enjoyment through stimulation of their scrotum or testicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The clitoris&lt;/b&gt;: The clitoris is similar to the penis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the only part of the body whose only known purpose is pleasure. The clitoral shaft is on the outside of the body, above the urinary opening within the vulva. This is what most people call the whole clitoris. That’s only one part of a much larger system that has parts both inside and outside the body. The crura, the corpus carvernosum, the urethral sponge and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#vestibular_bulbs&quot; title=&quot;Two portions of erectile tissue that are part of the internal clitoris. As with the penis, erection can occur within the vulva due to these bulbs.  Sometimes called the clitoral bulbs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;vestibular bulbs&lt;/a&gt; are all on the inside of the body. They are also parts of the clitoris that can provide pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The vagina&lt;/b&gt;: The vagina is a muscular tube inside the body. On one end of it is the vaginal opening, the place where things can go inside. On the other the end, inside the body, it ends at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#cervix&quot; title=&quot;The opening to the uterus, the bottom of which is at the back end of the vagina.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;cervix&lt;/a&gt;, which is the opening to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#uterus&quot; title=&quot;In people assigned female at birth (unless it has been surgically removed or was not formed in utero), an internal, muscular reproductive organ in the pelvis. During pregnancy, this is where a fetus will develop. When not pregnant, it is the lining of the uterus, when shed each cycle, that provides a menstrual period.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;uterus&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of nerve endings in the vagina are in the first third of it closer to the opening. You may have heard of the “G-spot” inside the vagina. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#G-spot&quot; title=&quot;A portion of the internal clitoris 1-3 inches within the vagina on the anterior (front) wall which can be sexually stimulating and which is often associated with ejaculation by those with vaginas.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;G-spot&lt;/a&gt; is also part of the clitoral system and is within that first third of the vagina. Touching that area can be pleasurable. The back two-thirds of the vagina aren’t very sensitive. This is one reason why people with vaginas usually won’t reach orgasm or experience a lot of pleasure from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#vaginal_intercourse&quot; title=&quot;When a penis or sex toy is inserted into and held by the vagina while partners move their bodies as feels good to them for the purpose of either sexual stimulation and/or reproduction.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;vaginal intercourse&lt;/a&gt; alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#labia&quot; title=&quot;On the vulva, both inner (labia minora) and outer (labia majora) sets of skin with sensory nerve endings which surround the vaginal opening.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;labia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#mons&quot; title=&quot;A mound of fatty tissue (skin) covering the upper portion of the vulva. In adult people, this area is usually where much of the pubic hair is.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;mons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: The mons, the part of the vulva where most of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#pubic_hair&quot; title=&quot;The hair that grows around the genital and anal regions (often extending a ways up the front or back and onto the inner thights) and usually first appears around puberty. It may vary in color, texture, length, and thickness.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;pubic hair&lt;/a&gt; is, has sensory nerve endings. The labia are the parts that look like lips or folds of skin. They are also very sensitive. Because of how everything fits closely together in the genitals, touching these body parts can also stimulate the parts of the clitoris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone’s genitals or other body parts behave the same way. Not everyone likes or feels the same things or areas of the body in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What feels good to one person during sex or masturbation can, and often will, change over time. It also won’t always feel the same way with one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#partner&quot; title=&quot;In a sexual context, a person with whom someone is having some kind of sex. The term &amp;quot;partner&amp;quot; can be used for all kinds of relationships, not just serious ones. &amp;quot;Partner&amp;quot; can also mean the person someone is with in a romantic or familial partnership.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;partner&lt;/a&gt; as it does with another. What feels good varies from person to person. That’s one reason it’s important for partners to talk to each other about what feels good during sex. Even though we all have the same or very similar body parts and systems, we each experience sex in a unique way.&lt;/p&gt;
