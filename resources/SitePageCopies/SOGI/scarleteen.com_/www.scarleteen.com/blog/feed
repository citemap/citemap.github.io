 <title>One last birthday card for Scarleteen!</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/one_last_birthday_card_for_scarleteen</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/InSexEdWeTrust_forweb.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: right; width: 400px; height: 400px;&quot; /&gt;I&#039;ve been saving this very wonderful birthday-card-of-sorts from the also-very-wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/relationships_sexual_identity_etc/becoming_out_a_totally_nonexhaustive_step_by_step_guide_to&quot;&gt;Liz&lt;/a&gt; for almost a year now, looking for just the right time to post it.  Seeing as we&#039;re two days away from the end of this 20th year and our next (our 21st!) birthday, it certainly feels like a good time. If you want to help us wrap up this big anniversary year with some support to help us stick around for years to come, you should know about a few cool things going on right now or coming up soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;1) Any &lt;a href=&quot;https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/1433116?code=STPRIMARY&quot;&gt;new donor&lt;/a&gt; this month gets advance access to our new zine!  You can read all about that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/want_a_sneak_peek_at_our_forthcoming_zine_or_us_asking_you_for_an_end_of_the&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;2) For those who can and want to order some great, non-toxic and affordable toys, Kenton at Funkit Toys has made some special just for us -- &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.funkittoys.com/product-page/scarleteen-nofrilldo&quot;&gt;they&#039;re scarlet, even!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -- to help support Scarleteen. $10 from every $24 dildo and $18 from every $40 model go to us, and you can even add an extra donation while you&#039;re there if you&#039;re feeling extra generous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;3) At the end of the month, there will be opportunities for two more donors to win &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Scarleteen/status/1204440666673205250&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this big prize&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;! -&lt;em&gt; Heather&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;If you had told me fifteen years ago that I&#039;d be doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; education as a job I&#039;d probably have laughed at you. Can you imagine: &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; telling &lt;em&gt;others&lt;/em&gt; that you can have a healthy sexual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#relationship&quot; title=&quot;Some kind of ongoing interaction or association with another person, place or thing.

There are all kinds of relationships: family relationships, friendships, romantic relationships, and sexual relationships. Sometimes there is an overlap where we have more than one kind of relationship with someone. Sometimes people use the word relationship to only mean a romantic, &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot;, or committed relationship, even though that&amp;#039;s not all this word means.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;relationship&lt;/a&gt; with your body, let alone admitting it to &lt;em&gt;myself&lt;/em&gt;!? A lot has changed since then for me – the Liz of today is more confident, more comfortable with herself (not to mention finally grew boobs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;What hasn&#039;t changed in that time is that Scarleteen has remained my #1 sex ed resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;As a young teenager who&#039;d only really seen potential versions of herself on websites that, as a minor, I had to lie to gain access to, finding a site that was not only age-appropriate but that never talked down to me just because I was young changed the way I thought: about both the sex I could one day have, and the types of relationships I might form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;I don&#039;t consider myself to have been &quot;born a boy,&quot; but it&#039;s nevertheless the way that a lot of people saw me as I was growing up. When facing down the barrel of expectations that brought along with it, I sought out a new set of expectations and ideas altogether. When I was stuck, or alone, or scared, it felt good knowing there was a place online I could turn to for help, and for support that I was even allowed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Many years later, as I&#039;m in the process of finding family of my own and learning from a whole new generation of young &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#queer&quot; title=&quot;In the context of sexuality, a broad term for sexual orientation that can describe any number of orientations which are not heterosexual. People who identify as queer may be bisexual or pansexual, gay or lesbian, questioning, asexual or more. &quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;queer&lt;/a&gt; people, it&#039;s an extraordinary privilege to be helping contribute to the same annals of advice that I sought comfort from, and that helped shape me into the adult I am today. I&#039;ve no shame in admitting they still do, too! Sex ed has no age limit, and as I revisit Scarleteen&#039;s pages now I still find myself learning and growing. That&#039;s not to say that it&#039;s perfect, or that every topic has been covered: I&#039;m excited for what another twenty years will bring!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;No birthday is complete without presents, and I believe the biggest gift you can give to yourself is the time and opportunity to explore what you want from life, love, sex, romance and relationships – whether that&#039;s all of them all the time, or only a few of them some of the time, thank you very much! To know that there are folk of every &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender&quot; title=&quot;Characteristics that are seen or presented as distinguishing between male and female in a society. Gender may or may not include assigned or chosen: social roles, feelings, behaviors and/or presentation or appearance.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt; and sexuality under the sun looking for a bit of guidance, or a word of love, and to be able to tell them that I have stood where they stand and survived is a humbling thing, just as I was told by the queers before me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;We all have to start learning somewhere, but we also have so much room to keep learning; to continue on a journey of knowledge about sexual health, practices and pleasure, and especially about ourselves and our own bodies. I will always be thankful for the tools that Scarleteen gave a scared young me, for the tools it continues to give me as a (for the most part) less scared older me, and for the tools I get to help build for the hundreds of thousands who access these pages every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/happy_20th_f_birthday_scarleteen&quot;&gt;Happy birthday Scarleteen&lt;/a&gt;, and here&#039;s to many more decades online!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Let Your Representatives Know: It&#039;s Time to Fund Comprehensive Sex Education!</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/sam_w/let_your_representatives_know_its_time_to_fund_comprehensive_sex_education</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I had the chance to attend an inaugural &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; education policy convening in Washington, D.C. , sponsored by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://siecus.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexuality Information and Education Counsel of the United States&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (SIECUS), with a host of other amazing sex educators and advocates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;SIECUS &amp;quot;I Heart Sex Ed&amp;quot; graphic&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/v9wh2OOa_400x400.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float: right; width: 400px; height: 400px;&quot; /&gt;One of the reasons we all came to D.C. was to do a day of advocacy for sex education on capitol hill. Specifically, we were talking to representatives and asking them to co-sponsor two bills: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hr2720&quot;&gt;The Real Education for Healthy Youth Act&lt;/a&gt; (REHYA)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hr2701&quot;&gt;The Youth Access to Sexual Health Services Act&lt;/a&gt; (YASHS)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do those bills do, and why were we advocating for them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REHYA would create the first ever federal funding stream for comprehensive sex education. That’s right, &lt;em&gt;the first&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bills like REHYA have been introduced before, but never passed. Instead administrations, including the current one, continue pouring a bunch of money into abstinence programming (or “sexual risk avoidance” programs, which are just abstinence-only programs with a longer, sneakier name). You know, those programs that have been shown time and again to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2017/abstinence-only-until-marriage-programs-are-ineffective-and-harmful-young-people&quot;&gt;ineffective and often actively harmful&lt;/a&gt;? REHYA would not only direct money towards medically accurate, comprehensive sex education, it would also put measures in place to prevent any more funds from being wasted on abstinence-only programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YASHA’s goal is to break down barriers that prevent already marginalized young people — like young people of color, immigrant youth, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#LGBTQ&quot; title=&quot;L = lesbian, G = gay, B = bisexual, T = transgender, Q = queer or questioning. Additional letters sometimes added include U = unsure, I = intersex, P = pansexual, A= asexual, S = straight allies.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;LGBTQ&lt;/a&gt; youth, youth in foster care, homeless youth, and young people in juvenile detention — from accessing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual&quot; title=&quot;About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; and reproductive health care they need. It’s a logical companion to REHYA, because even for people who get comprehensive sex education, if their access to sexual health services is limited — or doesn’t exist, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#period&quot; title=&quot;The fluid, which contains blood, from the shedding of the uterine lining usually at the end of each fertility cycle. Or, that flow you perhaps may have experienced once while shouting, &amp;quot;Oh thank GAWD!&amp;quot;&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;period&lt;/a&gt; — that information can only do so much for them. Knowing you need to get an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#STI&quot; title=&quot;Sexually transmitted infections: illness, infection and/or disease which is often or can be transmitted through sexual or other intimate contact, like HIV, Chlamydia or Herpes. Some people call STIs STDs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;STI&lt;/a&gt; screening can’t do you much good if you lack the resources, be they transportation, money, safe and supportive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#adults&quot; title=&quot;People older than you who probably drive you batty. Or, people whose age in years exceeds the legal age of majority; people considered to be adults by law.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;adults&lt;/a&gt;, or basic control over your daily life, to access that screening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see the difference inclusive, accurate sex education makes every day with our users first-hand, and the hurdles many of them still face when it comes to accessing basic sexual healthcare. We’ve watched with frustration as funding pools for comprehensive sex education have remained small, while abstinence-only programming stays flooded with cash. These policies would be an immense breath of fresh air, and would also signal a long-overdue change in how sex education has usually been approached in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more personal level, I live in a rural area in a state whose sex education policies are inconsistent at best and barely-there at worst. Even Reno, the nearest big city, faced several months of delays when developing their new sex education curriculum for high schoolers, as there was resistance to the inclusion of a lesson about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender_identity&quot; title=&quot;A person&amp;#039;s own sense of whether and in what sense they feel they might be a man, a woman, neither, a mixture of genders, or another gender entirely.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender identity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual_orientation&quot; title=&quot;A term -- like homosexual, heterosexual, bisexual, queer, straight, lesbian, gay, asexual -- used to describe a person&amp;#039;s usual or current pattern of emotional, romantic and/or sexual attraction to other people in terms of gender.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual orientation&lt;/a&gt;. In order for the lesson to be included it was given a preamble that, while it states that the lesson is taught from an inclusive perspective, makes it seem as though the existence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#queer&quot; title=&quot;In the context of sexuality, a broad term for sexual orientation that can describe any number of orientations which are not heterosexual. People who identify as queer may be bisexual or pansexual, gay or lesbian, questioning, asexual or more. &quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;queer&lt;/a&gt; and trans people is a matter of opinion and not, you know, the lived experience of people who may very well be existing right there in the classroom where the preamble is being read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RHEYA would prevent situations like what happened in Reno. If funds are put towards inclusive, accurate programming, youth in locations that would otherwise have crummy, harmful, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#exclusive&quot; title=&quot;Something that is not divided or shared with others; which excludes others based on a given criteria.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;exclusive&lt;/a&gt; sex education will actually stand a chance of getting the inclusive information they need without things like caveats to appease the close-minded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does that all sound like something you’d like to see?&lt;/strong&gt; We sure would. If you live in the U.S, you can fill out &lt;a href=&quot;https://siecus.salsalabs.org/support-rehya-yashs/index.html&quot;&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt;, courtesy of SIECUS, and let your representatives know that you support comprehensive sex education, access to sexual and reproductive healthcare and these proposed policies.&lt;/p&gt;

If your inbox has been anything like mine, you&#039;ve already suffered through a solid week of targeted marketing landmines and nonstop sparkly coercions to spend money buying everything and anything on earth, no less. So, I&#039;m going to do us all a solid and keep it simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s the end of the year -- also the end of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/happy_20th_f_birthday_scarleteen&quot;&gt;our 20th anniversary year&lt;/a&gt;, something any fully independent, feminist, grassroots nonprofit, let alone one focused on progressive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; education for young people, rarely survives to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have it to give, and you&#039;d like to give it to us, &lt;a href=&quot;https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/1433116?code=STPRIMARY&quot;&gt;we&#039;re asking for some financial support from yo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://donatenow.networkforgood.org/1433116?code=STPRIMARY&quot;&gt;u&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;We intend to use that support the way we usually do, to fund all of the things we&#039;ve done over the last 20+ years and want to keep doing like:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Making and publishing the kind of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/its_quickies_our_new_series_of_short_fast_sex_ed_summaries&quot;&gt;creative&lt;/a&gt;, progressive, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/disability&quot;&gt;inclusive&lt;/a&gt; (and in so many ways!), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/sexuality&quot;&gt;affirming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/advice&quot;&gt;caring&lt;/a&gt; sex, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual&quot; title=&quot;About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; health and relationships content that our readers ask for, want and need; content and approaches to sex education that have also helped to move the field of sex ed forward over the last 20+ years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Providing one-on-one services to our users through our moderated message boards, text/SMS helpline, live chat and advice columns, as well as some in-person outreach, all given by real, live people -- not bots -- and whose responses are original and responsive, not pre-written scripts so common in many digital/online help services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Supporting and amplifying other great sex and relationships education, content and actions from all around the world, from all kinds of people, in our content, direct services and all &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Scarleteen/&quot;&gt;our&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Scarleteen&quot;&gt;social&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://hellyeahscarleteen.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;media&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/scarleteenorg/&quot;&gt;channels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Making or taking part in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/wait_what_its_finally_here_it_is&quot;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; and other kinds of print media projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On that note, we&#039;d like to offer new donors in the next month the little gift we&#039;re given to our current donors:&lt;/strong&gt; a new, interactive, printable zine!*&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ll be releasing the zine for free to everyone come the new year, but if you&#039;d like to get it early, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; help us keep on keepin&#039;on, it&#039;s yours now with &lt;a href=&quot;https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/1433116?code=STPRIMARY&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;any one-time donation of $20 or more, or any new recurring donation of $10 a month or more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#039;re welcome to use it for yourself, for your family, or, if you teach sex ed, to use it with whomever you teach. You can even take pictures of it and brag about how gobstoppingly righteous and adorable it is online, if you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;a teeny sample of the zine!&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/iamawesome.png&quot; style=&quot;margin: 5px; width: 350px; height: 168px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;I don&#039;t want to say too much about it yet, mostly because it&#039;s fun to have a secret, but also because we want to wait to say more until it&#039;s available to everyone. But I can tell you now that: 1) it&#039;s seriously awesome, just like you (&lt;em&gt;awwww&lt;/em&gt;), 2) one of our amazing staff, Al Washburn, came up with it a couple years ago and we&#039;ve been using a version of it in our in-person outreach for a while, 3) this updated version includes rad new illustrations from &lt;a href=&quot;https://archiebongiovanni.com/&quot;&gt;Archie Bongiovanni&lt;/a&gt;, and 4) it is going to be very hard for you not to pass this around everywhere so almost everyone you know can use it, which is great, because come 2020, our hope is that&#039;s &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what everyone does with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That&#039;s it!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If you can donate, &lt;a href=&quot;https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/1433116?code=STPRIMARY&quot;&gt;here&#039;s where you go to do that!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  All of us here at Scarleteen fling our enduring gratitude in your general direction!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can&#039;t, we certainly understand. Know that we stand with and for you in what are likely long-frustrated wishes for pay equity, fewer people to take care of with little to no help, and catching a break for a change, for crying out loud. &lt;3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wish everyone a great rest-of-2019, and, presuming you&#039;ve all had the decade many of us have around here, we wish that the next one is considerably better. Kudos to all of us for making it through: it sure hasn&#039;t been easy. Here&#039;s to a new decade of all the good things, very much including all the great sex and relationships education all of our hearts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#desire&quot; title=&quot;A feeling of strongly wanting something. In the context of sex, desire can be a strong feeling of a physical and psychological want for any kind of sex.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;desire&lt;/a&gt; for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* Some fine print:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;Be sure when you donate that you use a current, working email so you can get your copies! &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;small&gt;After you make your $10+ recurring donation or your $20+ one-time donation, we&#039;ll email you the files -- one for print, one for digital-only use -- within 3 days. If you don&#039;t hear from us by then, check your spam folder. If we&#039;re not hiding in there, you can email us at: feedbackAT scarleteenDOTcom.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

 <title>For the love of they, them and we who use them.</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/for_the_love_of_they_them_and_we_who_use_them</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At long last, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2019/09/17/merriam-webster-adds-non-binary-prounoun-they-dictionary/&quot;&gt;Merriam-Webster has added they and them, as singular nonbinary pronouns, specifically, to the dictionary&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of us who are nonbinary, who use these pronouns, or both, didn&#039;t need a dictionary to validate our identities, or the pronouns we use.  Anyone and everyone&#039;s identities and pronouns are valid, whether the dictionary or other cultural institutions acknowledge them or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#039;s say that again, just for good measure, as well as for those who still don&#039;t yet have the privilege: &lt;strong&gt;everyone&#039;s identities and pronouns are valid, whether the dictionary or other cultural institutions acknowledge them or not&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They and them in this kind of use were grammatically correct and in use for a very, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; long time -- at least all the way back to the 1300 in the English language alone, a thing our pals at Merriam-Webster &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they&quot;&gt;have not only already backed us up on&lt;/a&gt;, but explain the context of pretty nicely, so I hopefully can be done, finally, with having to say much more about it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respectfully -- I say that because I was a child who literally read the dictionary front to back by choice; I have a level of reverence for the dictionary that borders on religious -- they do miss the mark a bit in that blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some, being nonbinary or using they/them is, as they say, about being (they actually say &lt;em&gt;&quot;seeming,&quot;&lt;/em&gt; which is awfully cringeworthy, so I&#039;m going to just say being instead and hope that someone takes the hint) neither male or female, or man or woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For others, it&#039;s more complex, dimensional or just plain different than that. It might be about being outside or beyond that whole system of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender&quot; title=&quot;Characteristics that are seen or presented as distinguishing between male and female in a society. Gender may or may not include assigned or chosen: social roles, feelings, behaviors and/or presentation or appearance.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt; so completely -- as is often the case for people who identify as non-gendered -- to the point that &quot;neither&quot; doesn&#039;t make sense, much like describing a tomato as &quot;neither suitable building material for an office building nor a reliable means of human transportation,&quot; wouldn&#039;t be a sound way of talking about the systems tomatoes are even any remotely feasible part of. If you just don&#039;t feel any attachment or orientation within a system at all, or maybe don&#039;t even believe in its essential existence, &quot;neither&quot; in reference to that system and you just might not work at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They/them or being nonbinary can also be about being -- sometimes, as is the case for many genderfluid people, or even all the time -- a nonbinary man or a woman (or both, or all: these things aren&#039;t &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#exclusive&quot; title=&quot;Something that is not divided or shared with others; which excludes others based on a given criteria.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;exclusive&lt;/a&gt; in nonbinary frameworks like they are in binary ones), but not feeling, experiencing, or presenting those as binary, where there are only two genders or sexes, or where they are framed as opposites or two parts of one whole. Those are just a couple examples. Nonbinary identities, they/them pronouns, and the people who use them have a wide range of experiences and expressions, and it&#039;s usually about a lot more than just not fitting into male/female or man/woman.  For more on this, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nonbinary.miraheze.org/wiki/List_of_nonbinary_identities&quot;&gt;this wiki is a good place to start&lt;/a&gt;, and so is Archie Bongiovanni and Tristan Jimerson&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.archiebongiovanni.com/A-Quick-And-Easy-Guide-To-They-Them-Pronouns&quot;&gt;Quick and Easy Guide to They/Them Pronouns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recent addition to the dictionary isn&#039;t about they/them being brand new, so much as having evolved to have an additional, common use over the last few decades, and this change doesn&#039;t make they/them correct when they weren&#039;t before. &lt;strong&gt;This recent addition is, one hopes, about recognizing and acknowledging a use of these words that has become common and -- and this is the best part -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://consciousstyleguide.com/gender-sex-sexuality/&quot;&gt;recognizing and acknowledging the existence of those of us who use those words and others like them in this way and supporting us in language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also gives those of us who use they/them the ability to at least say, &lt;em&gt;&quot;Go look it up in the dictionary,&quot;&lt;/em&gt; which is going to be an awfully nice break from the myriad arguments, defenses and sometimes out-and-out fights we all get constantly cornered into engaging in, with way too many people, if and when we have the audacity to ask people to just call us what we want to be called. Thanks, Merriam-Webster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&#039;m also hoping -- for all of us, myself very much included -- this might help to more quickly usher in the end of:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Articles announcing someone uses they/them pronouns that STILL misgender them, for crying out loud (Sam Smith literally told the whole world their pronouns, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.out.com/celebs/2019/9/14/ap-misgendered-sam-smith-article-about-their-pronouns&quot;&gt;and the AP reported on that &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;using the wrong pronouns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, something that had to be way harder and far more brain-breaky than just using the pronouns Sam handed over so clearly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Reading pieces that, when using my pronoun -- a thing I, like most people who use they/them, usually have to work very hard to get people to include in the first place -- say things like, &quot;Heather, who prefers they/them pronouns...&quot; That&#039;s &lt;em&gt;never &lt;/em&gt;written about people who use he or she: neither that they &quot;prefer&quot; he or she, nor that they use he or she. Instead, their pronouns just get used without comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While we&#039;re here, good form with this is not &quot;prefers.&quot; Our pronouns are our pronouns, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#period&quot; title=&quot;The fluid, which contains blood, from the shedding of the uterine lining usually at the end of each fertility cycle. Or, that flow you perhaps may have experienced once while shouting, &amp;quot;Oh thank GAWD!&amp;quot;&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;period&lt;/a&gt;; they are the pronouns we use. I &lt;/em&gt;prefer&lt;em&gt; people call me by my first name, not my full name. T&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;hey/them are my pronouns. Easy, right? To say which pronouns a person uses in context, you don&#039;t usually need to say which pronouns they use &lt;whatever pronouns=&quot;&quot;&gt; then use them. When people complain that using they/them is wordy or awkward, it&#039;s usually because the way &lt;/whatever&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;whatever pronouns=&quot;&quot;&gt;they&lt;/whatever&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;whatever pronouns=&quot;&quot;&gt; are doing it is wordy and awkward. You can just cut right to it and use the pronoun like you do with he or she, like, &quot;Though King Henry II used the royal we, he was only ever speaking for himself.&quot;&lt;/whatever&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Having to choose between he or she on things -- including things that identify us to others in very lasting or powerful ways, and sometimes matter more than how we ourselves &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; identify -- when we don&#039;t want to choose either, and when everyone should have a third option that can literally be used by everyone, anyway, no matter how they identify. Having a gender-neutral option -- on all things -- just makes sense, and not just for nonbinary people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Having to explain at the beginning of books or articles I write that I use they/them for myself and others, what it means, and ask people to go along with that as if I were asking them to engage in some kind of hard labor rather than just acknowledging our identities like they do for themselves and others who use he/she.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Experiencing someone painfully try and ask what pronouns a person uses while trying not to use he or she, when they can instead just say, &quot;What pronouns do they use?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ideally, people would and will respect our identities and our pronouns, dictionary inclusion or not. But, alas: we don&#039;t live in an ideal world, we live in this one.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I&#039;m not the only one who&#039;s got some feelings about people who NOW will get on board because of the authority dictionaries are afforded, but wouldn&#039;t before when we -- the very best authority on ourselves -- told them who were were and what our pronouns are. Or people who will say that their only issue was that it was apparently not grammatically correct before, and has been deemed so now, not only because that&#039;s now what has actually happened, but because we all know that was never their actual issue. Their actual issue was that they didn&#039;t accept or want to acknowledge our identities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that sounds like you, I think you&#039;ve got a great opportunity here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this makes you feel able to finally get on board with this right now, all the way? You can do so without cloaking it in a bunch of malarkey about how it was just about grammar or lack of apparent proper locutionary authority. (We know it wasn&#039;t.) You can instead just do it in the very best way, the way that feels the most affirming for all of us, and make it about accepting us, and the words we use because WE say. Even better, if you&#039;ve got other identities or their words you&#039;re still not accepting yet, you can work on changing that now, instead of waiting for the dictionary to do it first. &lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>It&#039;s Quickies! Our new series of short, fast, sex ed summaries!</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/its_quickies_our_new_series_of_short_fast_sex_ed_summaries</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/Quickies_%20Article%20Images.png&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: right; width: 250px; height: 250px;&quot; /&gt;Over the years, we’ve had many Scarleteen fans -- especially older siblings, aunts and uncles, cousins, camp counselors, babysitters or other folks who’ve loved Scarleteen for themselves and wanted to pass its goodness on to the younger people in their lives -- ask if they should refer preteens to our site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, most of our content is aimed at and made expressly for those who are in their mid-to-late teens or their early-to-mid twenties. Our readers and users have generally wanted and most appreciated in-depth, longer pieces with information and approaches most relevant for their age groups. Our content can work for some younger readers, but in general, due to its length and depth alone, it just usually isn&#039;t that accessible for most younger readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the subject matter we cover also won’t be all that relevant for them: preteens or very young teens, for instance, aren’t typically going to need to manage long-term &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual&quot; title=&quot;About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; relationships, sexual healthcare or more complicated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#relationship&quot; title=&quot;Some kind of ongoing interaction or association with another person, place or thing.

There are all kinds of relationships: family relationships, friendships, romantic relationships, and sexual relationships. Sometimes there is an overlap where we have more than one kind of relationship with someone. Sometimes people use the word relationship to only mean a romantic, &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot;, or committed relationship, even though that&amp;#039;s not all this word means.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;relationship&lt;/a&gt; models, make choices about cohabitation or often even yet be considering the kinds of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#contraception&quot; title=&quot;Devices, medications or behaviors used to intentionally aim to prevent pregnancy, including the condom, the cervical barrier, the implant, the patch, the pill, the rhythm method, the ring, the shot, the IUD, spermicide and withdrawal.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;contraception&lt;/a&gt; or even most STIs are a potential issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;re not worried that our content will harm or traumatize younger readers who try and read it (that&#039;s not a thing), we just know much of it won&#039;t fit most of their needs that well. Plus, while seeing just how much content we have on the site can feel like a real boon when you’re a little older, it can feel overwhelming to someone younger, especially someone younger who might get the idea they will need &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; that content in order to manage their sexual life. We’ve always done our best to be in-depth, because sex, sexuality and relationships are complex, but to also make things that ultimately make sex, sexuality and relationships feel &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; manageable for our readers and users: we certainly don’t want to make it seem harder or more complicated than it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;quotecontent&quot;&gt; A few excellent sex ed resources online and off to get started with for the younger set are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amaze.org/&quot;&gt;Amaze and Amaze, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;: a series of videos expressly designed to provide accurate, fun and engaging sex, sexuality and bodies education for pre-teens and very young teens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sex-Funny-Word-Bodies-Feelings/dp/1609806069&quot;&gt;Sex is a Funny Word&lt;/a&gt; by Cory Silverberg and Fiona Smyth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/wait_what_its_finally_here_it_is&quot;&gt;Wait, What? A Comic Book Guide to Relationships, Bodies and Growing Up&lt;/a&gt; by Heather Corinna and Isabella Rotman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uua.org/re/owl&quot;&gt;Our Whole Lives&lt;/a&gt; (OWL) program has curriculum for younger learners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/parents/middle-school/what-should-i-teach-my-middle-schooler-about-sex-and-sex&quot;&gt;This article from Planned Parenthood&lt;/a&gt; about how to talk with pre-teens about sex and sexuality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unhushed.org/info/curricula.php&quot;&gt;Unhushed curricula&lt;/a&gt; for middle school (and more)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But we’ve also always understood, appreciated and empathized with this ask!&lt;/strong&gt; Solid sex ed resources for preteens, particularly those that are also inclusive and sex-positive, are unfortunately still few and far between (but do check out that sidebar there for some good stuff). We want them, too! We’ve also figured that once &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/wait_what_its_finally_here_it_is&quot;&gt;Wait, What?&lt;/a&gt; c&lt;/em&gt;ame out, we might start seeing more users younger than our usual folks at Scarleteen. Lastly, we’ve also wanted some shorter, easier-to-read, more basic pieces for our disability section so we can start to do better when it comes to providing content for those with (or those helping people with) intellectual disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;All of this and more is why we are ultra-mega excited to introduce you to our new section: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/quickies&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quickies!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quickies are condensed, simplified versions of some of our most-read, best-loved content that also will often be a good fit for many somewhat younger users, or those new to sex education. They’re those core pieces of sex education that we think should be available to everybody, if possible. Like everything we do around here, they&#039;re highly inclusive, and don&#039;t uneccessarily or arbitrarily assign &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender&quot; title=&quot;Characteristics that are seen or presented as distinguishing between male and female in a society. Gender may or may not include assigned or chosen: social roles, feelings, behaviors and/or presentation or appearance.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt; or orientation to anything. We&#039;ve carefully created and edited them for lower literacy and to work better for those with intellectual disabilities, too.  (We&#039;re in the middle of working out a tiny hiccup on the index page with advice columns in this section, but expect that to be ironed out shortly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few months, we’ll be rolling out 20 - 30 of these. &lt;strong&gt;Today, we’re debuting with Quickies that cover:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/disability_quickies/quickies_sexual_consent_basics&quot;&gt;consent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/disability_quickies/quickies_sexual_anatomy&quot;&gt;sexual anatomy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/disability_quickies/quickies_periods_and_the_menstrual_cycle&quot;&gt;the menstrual cycle and periods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/disability_quickies/quickies_masturbation&quot;&gt;masturbation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/disability_quickies/quickies_healthy_relationships&quot;&gt;healthy relationships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/disability_quickies/quickies_intimacy&quot;&gt;intimacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/disability_quickies/quickies_crushes&quot;&gt;crushes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/disability_quickies/quickies_pleasure_and_fulfillment&quot;&gt;pleasure and fulfillment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But wait, there&#039;s more!&lt;/strong&gt; Each quickie also has a printable PDF version that fits on one double-sided sheet of paper, attached to the bottom of the page. Like our other content, these are free resources anyone is welcome to use within the basic conditions we mention on them (you use it as-is, including the attribution to us on it, and you don&#039;t use it for profit). We know how many educators -- whether you teach in a school, clinic, shelter, community group or in unschooling/homeschooling environments -- don’t have big (or even any) budgets for sex education materials. We hope having these free resources can help you out. They’re all potentially good for younger  or pre-adolescents, those with learning or other intellectual disabilities, ESL readers or groups where you just want to start with the barest basics of a thing and then branch out on your own from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They might also come in handy if you&#039;re doing general education, caretaking or group leading when any of these issues come up, so you can get a quick start to a bigger discussion. If you want to talk about more ways you can use these or any other part of Scarleteen in the work you do, we&#039;re always happy to help out with that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/contact&quot;&gt;just drop us a line here&lt;/a&gt;. In the event you&#039;ve got a special request for one of our articles you&#039;d love to see made into a quickie, feel free to let us know about that, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;re pretty stoked to get this project started, and we hope you&#039;re as into it as we are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

 <title>Wait, What? It&#039;s Finally Here?!? (It is!)</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/wait_what_its_finally_here_it_is</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It brings a loving, essential lens to matters of heart and soul, offering a roadmap not only to physical changes, but the complex social and emotional terrain of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#consent&quot; title=&quot;To agree to do something or give permission. In the context of sex, a person is giving full consent/is consenting when they freely and actively agree to do something sexual with someone else; however, the person still has the right to change their mind at any point. A person is NOT consenting if they do not actively agree, have been forced or pressured in some way or are in a state where they are incapable of full consent (such as when asleep, under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or below the age of consent).
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;consent&lt;/a&gt;, crushes, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#identity&quot; title=&quot;The defining character or personality of an individual; who we feel like we are as a person. Identity is often used to talk about sexual identity -- who we are as sexual people, which can include things like our sexual orientation, our preferences and things we like and want in sex and sexuality, our sexual politics -- or gender identity, who we feel we are and identify as (even if only to ourselves) in terms of our gender.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;identity&lt;/a&gt;. — Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg, &lt;strong&gt;Nurture the Wow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This dream team of creators came up with a book that is not only accessible but totally enjoyable to read! I’m so excited to see Wait, What? in every library, school and doctor’s office in 2019! — Archie Bongiovanni, &lt;strong&gt;A Quick &amp;amp; Easy Guide to They/Them Pronouns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/wwcover.png&quot; style=&quot;float: right; margin: 10px;&quot; /&gt;Isabella Rotman and I first started dreaming up a comic and activity book for pre-teens and very young teens in the fall of 2014, while Izzy was also working on the first version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isabellarotman.com/not-on-my-watch&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not On My Watch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Around the same time, I got into the thick of the second edition of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/article/read/all_about_s_e_x_the_scarleteen_book&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;S.E.X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, work I was doing for much of the next year, and Izzy worked on new illustrations for it, too. Then chronic pain and illness I&#039;d long struggled with began to get bad, and soon enough went from bad to worse to some-of-my-spine-literally-crumbling-and-collapsing epic bad. I was first away from the project due to my inability to do much of anything, then for a big surgery and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made our way back to it in 2017, and in fall of 2018, partnered with publisher Oni/Limerence Press, and our editor, Ari Yarwood. We then all worked our tushes off to get it all the way done, which is why today -- AT LONG LAST! SOUND THE TRUMPETS! DOO DO DOO DOOOOOO! -- we can finally present you with &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait, What? A Comic Book Guide to Relationships, Bodies and Growing Up, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;a book we love and loved making very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m so glad that throughout this process, the book has not only been able to keep being all we wanted it to be when we first conceived it, but has become even better than we&#039;d first imagined. I got to make this book with one of my favorite creative collaborators and friends, and we both also got to work with &lt;a href=&quot;https://lukehoward.net/&quot;&gt;Luke Howard&lt;/a&gt;, a great colorist and awesome human, and our team at Oni/Limerence, and now we get to share it with all of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very start of all this, we had in mind making something of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; ed prequel: some of the more foundational, social information and context so often left out of most sex ed, that would give a young person a good start on things no matter what kind of sex and relationships education they got later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;d hoped to do something that could show young people how they could talk well with each other about so much of the tricky stuff that&#039;s happening or showing up in a bigger way for them at this time of life. Things like: changing bodies and relationships, crushes, healthy boundaries, identity, safety, consent, crummy cultural ideas that can really hurt people and mess us all up and how to find and keep -- and themselves give -- good support. I&#039;ve seen young people do this with each other firsthand, and we both wanted to show young people and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#adults&quot; title=&quot;People older than you who probably drive you batty. Or, people whose age in years exceeds the legal age of majority; people considered to be adults by law.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;adults&lt;/a&gt; what it can look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted it to be the kind of book that Izzy and I would actually make as the team we are: something warm and sweet, real and sensitive, open and honest, and fun and full of little things we love, like our pets and our pet peeves, and things we geek out on, like rollerskating, what garbage virginity constructs are, and a certain platypus we just know you&#039;re going to love (I even got to name a character after Sonia Sotomayor!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also very much wanted to be sure to create something that was highly inclusive, which is still sadly hard to find in books about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#puberty&quot; title=&quot;The process of physical and sexual changes from childhood to adulthood, initiated by hormone signals from the brain to the gonads. Puberty usually takes several years to complete -- sometimes even more then five or six -- and changes the brain, bones, muscles, skin, breasts and reproductive organs. &quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;puberty&lt;/a&gt;, sex and relationships. I believe we&#039;ve even been able to release one of the first -- if not the first --- books for this age group that talks about puberty without assigning &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender&quot; title=&quot;Characteristics that are seen or presented as distinguishing between male and female in a society. Gender may or may not include assigned or chosen: social roles, feelings, behaviors and/or presentation or appearance.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt; to bodies or parts, and were able to bring other kinds of inclusion in that are really important to us both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/wwpd1_0.png&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/wwpd2.png&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/wwpd3.png&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;We truly love all our characters -- oh my goodness, &lt;em&gt;sooooo muuuuuch -- &lt;/em&gt;and every section, but I wanted to share one with you as a treat for our debut that we&#039;re both particularly excited about, and not just because it includes you-can-really-cut-them-out paper dolls. But also because of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the way this section &lt;strong&gt;(text and descriptions are at the bottom of the page for those using screen readers)&lt;/strong&gt; talks about and shows &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender_identity&quot; title=&quot;A person&amp;#039;s own sense of whether and in what sense they feel they might be a man, a woman, neither, a mixture of genders, or another gender entirely.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender identity&lt;/a&gt; and expression, and I particularly love the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#relationship&quot; title=&quot;Some kind of ongoing interaction or association with another person, place or thing.

There are all kinds of relationships: family relationships, friendships, romantic relationships, and sexual relationships. Sometimes there is an overlap where we have more than one kind of relationship with someone. Sometimes people use the word relationship to only mean a romantic, &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot;, or committed relationship, even though that&amp;#039;s not all this word means.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;relationship&lt;/a&gt; between Max and Yoshimi: you can tell how Max&#039;s sister probably had and has a whole lot to do with how confident and safe Max feels in &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; identity, and how Yoshimi&#039;s big sister energy is very clearly appreciated and felt by all the friends (a thing we suspect some of the younger siblings of Scarleteen readers may also experience).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like every other section of the book, too, but I don&#039;t want to give it all away (I do, actually, but I know I&#039;m not supposed to)!  So, here&#039;s more of the scoop on the book as a whole, and some places to order it online if you don&#039;t have access to a copy yet at the library or can&#039;t get to a bookstore in person who&#039;s got it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you&#039;ll love it as much as we do, but what we hope even more is that you&#039;ll give it to a young person in your life and that &lt;em&gt;they&#039;ll&lt;/em&gt; love it as much as we do, and maybe even just a little more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Wait-What/Heather-Corinna/9781620106594&quot;&gt;From our publisher&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; From Heather Corinna, founder and director of &lt;i&gt;Scarleteen.com&lt;/i&gt;, and Isabella Rotman, cartoonist and sex educator, comes a graphic novel guide that covers essential topics for preteens and young teens about their changing bodies and feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fun and easy-to-read guide from expert sex educators that gives readers a good basis and an age-appropriate start with sex, bodies and relationships education. The perfect complement to any school curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A wonderful guide to topics adolescents are curious about, presenting information in relatable, gender-inclusive text and clever illustrations. This is the book adolescents—and their parents—have been looking for. — Melanie Davis, PhD, CSE, &lt;strong&gt;Our Whole Lives Program Associate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Groundbreaking sexuality educator Corinna, founder of the website Scarleteen, works with cartoonist Rotman to bring her knowledge and experience to this slim but mighty guide…This book consistently puts the needs of its readers first, meticulously working to emphasize gender diversity, individuality, and the messiness of adolescence….Body parts are intentionally ungendered, sexual orientations are shown as fluid and joyful, and there is a constant emphasis on the importance of friendships and mutual support. While brief, this guide manages to cover crucial topics thoroughly and humorously, reassuring readers that while all of this is a big deal, it’s something they can handle. The cartoony illustrations are appealing and fun, the book includes interactive activities such as word searches and crossword puzzles, and there’s a fairly thorough glossary in the back. This extremely modern guide to growing up excels in its field.  – &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/heather-corinna/wait-what/?fbclid=IwAR0Yn_UtZIe1-F4wqp_O7r7wTP1nHwobybtiy2mRdZPhiEzn2RQzqQpdo3M&quot; onclick=&quot;javascript:window.open(&#039;https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/heather-corinna/wait-what/?fbclid=IwAR0Yn_UtZIe1-F4wqp_O7r7wTP1nHwobybtiy2mRdZPhiEzn2RQzqQpdo3M&#039;); return false;&quot;&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text and description of featured pages:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Paper dolls of Max, includes jeans, roller skates, jacket, engineer boots, Weird Platypus t-shirt, bandana, button-down, witch hat, powdered wig and a dress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Max:&lt;/em&gt; Everyone should be able to wear what they like and feel comfortable in, whatever their gender.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(at bottom of the page) * Gender is basically our own internal sense — not what anyone else thinks or says about it, but how we feel — of being a girl, a boy, both or neither, and the unique ways we feel like or express those feelings. For more definitions of terms we use in this book, check out the glossary in the back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;em&gt;Max’s sister, Yoshimi, reaching into the last frame to take a dress back from Max: &lt;/em&gt;You know it’s not okay to take my stuff without asking me first, Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max: Sibling fail! Sorry, Yoshimi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yoshimi, holding up the dress:&lt;/em&gt; Max always takes this when they want to show their “girly side.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yoshimi: &lt;/em&gt;For some people, gender feels like it does for Max. Some parts of them feel girl-like. Some parts feel boy-like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other people go back and forth, or feel like both at the same time. Some don’t feel like either. Some people don’t relate to or feel masculinity or femininity at all. Other people always and only feel like boys or men, or like girls or women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t feel like I have a “boy-side” or like I have “sides” at all. All my sides feel girly.  There’s nothing right or wrong about how Max experiences gender, how I do, or how girls like Malia or Alexis do. All those ways are right ways, because they all feel right to each of us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yoshimi, popping &quot;It&#039;s a Boy&quot; and &quot;It&#039;s a Girl!&quot; balloons with a pin:&lt;/em&gt; There’s nothing more right or real about how Alexis and Malia are girls than how I am just because when they were born a doctor said they were girls, and when I was born, a doctor said I was a boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yoshimi, arm in arm with Alexia and Malia:&lt;/em&gt; Trans girls like me — whose sense of gender isn’t the same as the sex a doctor said I was when I was born, that&#039;s all — are just as real as girls like Alexis and Malia. That&#039;s also true about trans boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yoshimi, Alexia and Malia, with Max photobombing in front:&lt;/em&gt; All three of us are girls because that’s how we all feel and that&#039;s what we all say we are. Max is…well, whoever Max is today, because that’s what they say.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sexuality in Color: Euphoria</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/chant%C3%A9_thurmond/sexuality_in_color_euphoria</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/incolor.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: right; width: 234px; height: 166px;&quot; /&gt;If anyone had told me when I was younger that thirty-something Chanté would be binge-watching teenage television dramas in 2019, I sure would have been surprised. But I also wouldn’t have predicted there’d be something to watch like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbo.com/euphoria/season-1/1-pilot&quot;&gt;Euphoria&lt;/a&gt;, HBO’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/06/euphoria-zendaya-hbo-review&quot;&gt;new teen drama&lt;/a&gt; released just in time for summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;The first thing that hit me was the main character, Rue, played by the one and only Zendaya: she reminded me of myself and some of my friends I grew up with back in Iowa. The list of our similarities is longer than our differences. Like me, Rue is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#cisgender&quot; title=&quot;Describes people who have a gender identity which is traditionally thought to “match” their assigned sex. For instance, someone who was assigned male at birth who identifies as a man. Often used in relation to transgender.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;cisgender&lt;/a&gt;, biracial girl being raised in a single-parent household in the middle of white suburbia. She’s also the eldest daughter and a protective big sister with a small chip on her shoulder. Rue’s independent mind and her strongwilled nature remind me most of myself. I relate to her slight defiance, especially as someone who also was very much an independent thinker who often resisted the popular opinions of my high school peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Our subtle differences (like the fact that her father is absent due to him dying, while mine was incapable of taking care of us due to his own substance &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#abuse&quot; title=&quot;Purposeful harm or mistreatment of another person, which can be verbal, emotional, physical or sexual. An ongoing pattern or cycle of such mistreatment or harm can characterize an abusive relationship.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;abuse&lt;/a&gt;) didn’t really get in the way of me relating to Rue’s narrative and those of the rest of the cast. In fact, there were many subnarratives that felt super familiar to me and compelled me to continue watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;I was excited to see what would unfold as Rue shared more of her mixed girl narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/zendaya-euphoria.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: left; width: 500px; height: 290px;&quot; /&gt;I know how important it is for brown and Black young people to see characters who look like them, and I know how much &lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;longed for someone who looked like me and had a not-so-perfect home life to tell the rest of the world what it can actually like to be a biracial teenage girl. When I was seventeen, I craved raw honesty about what it meant to grow up in a place where kids were isolated but also privileged. I also secretly hoped someone would be brave enough to share what it meant to be a little unruly, and how easy it was to be enticed by drugs, alcohol, house parties and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;At the end of the day, I just remember wanting an alternative to the whitewashed narratives that were constantly being rerun on TV. I grew up during an era when shows like “My So-Called Life”, “Saved By The Bell”, “Dawson’s Creek” and “The Real World” were constantly playing in the background. None of those shows were a true depiction of what was really happening in my life. I brushed them off and didn’t really take any of them seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;I recently came across this article — &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/euphoria-and-the-black-girls-coming-of-age_n_5d0145c6e4b0304a1208fa71&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Euphoria And The Black Girl’s Coming Of Age&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — by Zeba Blay: she shared feelings about Euphoria that really resonated with me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The dearth of coming-of-age stories about black girls is heavily predicated on the fact that, so often, black girls aren’t given the space to even be girls. They’re often hyper-sexualized from an early age, and if they take the initiative to be intentional about exploring their sexuality, they’re deemed as “fast.” Unlike white teens, black girls are rarely given room to mess up, to make mistakes, to grow. Rue is a game-changing character in this sense because she is, by her own admission, the ultimate fuck-up. Since the story is told from her point of view, we’re put in a position where we can empathize with her.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rue runs the narrative, indeed. But it’s also powerful that Rue’s story isn’t simply the main story ― the lives of the other characters are also under her control. This storytelling approach further cements her importance, her necessity, her voice.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;That sums up a lot of why I’m so excited about the potential of this series. We &lt;i&gt;finally&lt;/i&gt; have access to a more honest first-person narrative led by someone who doesn’t have blue eyes and blonde hair and who isn’t growing up in a picture-perfect home tucked away in a gated community. While some viewers may not relate to Rue ethnically or racially, there’s a big chance many viewers &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; relate to the realities of growing up in a single-parent household or being a teenager (or having a friend) who’s struggling to overcome addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Every single episode is packed with typical coming-of-age themes: sex, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender&quot; title=&quot;Characteristics that are seen or presented as distinguishing between male and female in a society. Gender may or may not include assigned or chosen: social roles, feelings, behaviors and/or presentation or appearance.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt;, high school drama and gossip, relationships, experimentation with drugs, beauty standards, conflicts with parents and so on. But even these familiar themes don’t feel so predictable in this context. The rawness and the intersectionality of Euphoria seem to have the potential for relating to a wider range of teenagers and young adult viewers. Paired with the rich backstories we were introduced to in this first season, there are plenty of opportunities for this series to exhibit the true diversity of the characters and to explore even very traditional themes in very non-traditional ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;I believe that honest narratives beget honest conversations among young people, which is what we need whenever we’re talking about core parts of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#identity&quot; title=&quot;The defining character or personality of an individual; who we feel like we are as a person. Identity is often used to talk about sexual identity -- who we are as sexual people, which can include things like our sexual orientation, our preferences and things we like and want in sex and sexuality, our sexual politics -- or gender identity, who we feel we are and identify as (even if only to ourselves) in terms of our gender.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;identity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;I think they also allow us to feel more empathy and compassion with our own intersectionalities&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;more importantly, &lt;/i&gt;with&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;those of others, which are usually more difficult to relate to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Hats off to the writers, producers, directors and the cast who&#039;ve done an excellent job so far of showing us it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; possible to capture the tenderness of adolescence while still being honest and making space for its characters to explore, experiment and evolve. I didn’t think it was possible to lure me back to teenage drama, but &lt;i&gt;Euphoria&lt;/i&gt; has proven otherwise.

 <title>Sexuality In Color: On Caster Semenya</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/al/sexuality_in_color_on_caster_semenya</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caster_Semenya&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;sexuality in color&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/incolor.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: right; width: 234px; height: 166px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;(by Al Washburn)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caster_Semenya&quot;&gt;Caster Semenya&lt;/a&gt; is a gold-medal-winning Olympic athlete from South Africa. She&#039;s an incredibly talented runner who&#039;s won dozens of gold medals at competitions worldwide. But instead of having her athletic performance attributed to natural talent and hard work, it has been scrutinized and coupled with assertions that she can’t possibly have accomplished what she has without cheating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Who is to blame for this, you might ask?&lt;/i&gt; Just the usual suspects: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexism&quot; title=&quot;Prejudice, discrimination and oppression based on sex or gender or perceived or assigned sex or gender.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexism&lt;/a&gt;, cissexism, and white supremacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;In August of 2009 Caster Semenya came in first for the 800m dash (and set an annual record!) at the World Championships. She should have been able to celebrate her first international victory, but some folks became suspicious that she showed “rapid improvement” because her finish time was four seconds faster than one that she made one month earlier at the African Junior Championships. As a result, the IAFF (International Association of Athletics Federations) forced her to take a “sex verification test”, which appears to consist of a series of biomedical procedures and tests that vary in their degrees of invasiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;The fact that this test was sanctioned and conducted at all is bad enough, but to make things worse, some of Semenya’s private health information was also leaked to the media. By insisting that she submit to testing and subsequently failing uphold confidentiality, the IAFF and its entities violated Caster Semenya’s right to privacy, and also reinforced the narrative of public inquiry and scrutiny about Semenya’s integrity and personal legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;Her body became the subject of international debate and spectacle, much like Saartje Bartmann and countless other Black and brown bodies that were put on display at the hands of Western medical and scientific institutions throughout global history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Fast forward to April of 2018, when the IAFF announced revisions to their policies regarding “differences in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; development” for female athletes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;They were already in an ongoing legal case (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutee_Chand&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dutee Chand v. Athletics Federation of India (AFI) and The International Association of Athletics Federations&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) about their discriminatory practices, but they doubled down and took things a step further. They declared that female athletes with “hyperandrogenism” (higher-than-average levels of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#testosterone&quot; title=&quot;A steroid hormone in people&amp;#039;s bodies which is often blamed for a whole lot of things it isn&amp;#039;t actually responsible for.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;testosterone&lt;/a&gt; that are naturally produced in the bodies of some people assigned female sex at birth) would be required to undergo treatment via medication to lower their testosterone to arbitrary, pre-defined levels before they would be allowed to compete. This demonstrates a total lack of understanding of complexities of sex, bodies, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender&quot; title=&quot;Characteristics that are seen or presented as distinguishing between male and female in a society. Gender may or may not include assigned or chosen: social roles, feelings, behaviors and/or presentation or appearance.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt; – as if being a female is defined by a certain number of milligrams of testosterone present in one’s blood, or there’s not an array of diversity when it comes to testosterone levels among women. It forgets that the general concept of “biological sex,” flawed already, isn’t composed of half a dozen internal and external traits that can vary hugely from individual to individual and fluctuate over a lifetime. It also takes the often-used approach to bodies that show these variations – “let’s use a biomedical intervention to fix it so that it’s more like everyone else.” — instead of accepting them as one of many vast variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo of Caster Semanya by Mark Shearman&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/Caster-Semenya-Gold-Coast-2018-by-Mark-Shearman.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: left; width: 450px; height: 265px;&quot; /&gt;I don’t know all that much about competitive sports, but something that I’ve consistently heard about the Olympics is that it’s supposed to be a gathering of some of the world’s most talented and physically impressive bodies. If that’s true, then the miniscule athletic “advantage” of a naturally slightly higher level of testosterone in a female athlete’s body shouldn’t bother the IAFF any more than other inherent physical traits that can or do create advantages, like longer legs or wider hips. In reality, we see plenty of &lt;i&gt;male&lt;/i&gt; athletes such as Michael Phelps or Usain Bolt revered for their better-than-average physiques. But the true intentions of these policy changes (and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#cherry&quot; title=&quot;A slang term used to describe either the hymen/corona or something which signifies someone has not done something for the first time. &amp;quot;Popping the cherry&amp;quot; often describes doing something sexual for the first time, even though with first-time sex, there are not usually cherries or the popping of anything.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;cherry&lt;/a&gt; on top of a great big discrimination sundae) became evident when we learned that the policies only applied to athletes competing in 400m, 800m, 1500m, and hurdle combination events – Semenya’s only events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;The IAFF might claim they took these actions in order to maintain equity in the Olympic games, but that claim will not hold any weight until these policies are &lt;i&gt;enacted&lt;/i&gt; equitably. It’s also worth thinking about how Semenya’s victories may contradict some of the values that nationalists and white supremacists hold dear – that their countries’ chosen athletes are clearly superior, and therefore should be dominating the field. For example, when fellow athlete Lynsey Sharp [a white woman representing Great Britain] placed sixth in the 800m dash in the 2016 Rio Olympics, she &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/rio-2016-caster-semenyas-800m-win-lynsey-sharp-tears-intersex-debate-a7202251.html&quot;&gt;broke down into tears,&lt;/a&gt; having said, “Everyone can see it’s two separate races, so there’s nothing I can do”. (I find this particularly funny, because even if Caster Semenya had been taken out of the race, there still would have been &lt;i&gt;four other athletes&lt;/i&gt; who would have beaten Sharp.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;To her credit, Semenya has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/sport/av/africa/48875682&quot;&gt;incredibly brave and steadfast&lt;/a&gt; throughout the process, pushing back against these discriminatory rulings and continuing to kick ass on the racetrack despite all of the discrimination and harassment she’s faced. Her legal challenge to the “disorders of sex development” clause was recently denied, but she continues to advocate for herself and for people of all genders and sexes across the globe. While it’s unclear where exactly the topic of sex division and discrimination in the Olympic games is headed, you can be sure that I’ll be tuned into wherever Caster Semenya is going.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sexuality in Color: Can I Tell You a Story?</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/chant%C3%A9_thurmond/sexuality_in_color_can_i_tell_you_a_story</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;sexuality in color: writing outside the lines at Scarleteen&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/incolor.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: right; width: 234px; height: 166px;&quot; /&gt;After my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog/chant%25C3%25A9_thurmond/sexuality_in_color_some_reproductive_justice_heroes&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, I’d like&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;to share some audio storytelling via a few podcasts. I feel like storytelling often provides greater context when trying to understand the complexities of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#abortion&quot; title=&quot;A procedure to intentionally end a pregnancy before a birth. Miscarriage is also sometimes called &amp;quot;spontaneous abortion,&amp;quot; even though it is usually not intended.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt; care or reproductive justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;If you’re looking for more examples of diverse abortion stories, you can check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://theabortiondiary.com/the-abortion-diarist/&quot;&gt;Abortion Diary&lt;/a&gt; and consider starting with the host &lt;a href=&quot;http://theabortiondiary.com/the-abortion-diarist/&quot;&gt;Dr. Melissa Madera, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a Dominican-American doula, storyteller, reproductive justice advocate and founder of the project. Melissa&#039;s spoken to over 200 women about their abortions. There’s a neat feature on the site — &lt;a href=&quot;http://theabortiondiary.com/abortion-story-map/&quot;&gt;an abortion story map&lt;/a&gt; — where you can take a quick glance and see exactly where Melissa has conducted her interviews. Dr. Madera has done a great job capturing a variety of first-person accounts of abortion and you’ll likely find at least one story you can relate to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;There&#039;s also this awesome segment of the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.speakoutnow.org/speakoutwithtimwise&quot;&gt;Speak Out with Tim Wise&quot; podcast&lt;/a&gt; that features none other than the queen of reproductive justice herself: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.podomatic.com/podcasts/speakoutwithtimwise/episodes/2018-02-13T11_37_04-08_00&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Episode #22: Loretta Ross on Race, Reproductive Justice and Movement Building in an Age of Backlash&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Tim takes the first 18 minutes of the episode to share some history that helps frame their conversation — which begins around 19 minutes into the episode. Their conversation kicks off with the backstory of the Reproductive Justice movement and the founding of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sistersong.net&quot;&gt;SisterSong&lt;/a&gt;. Loretta breaks down the nuanced differences between reproductive freedom and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#reproductive_rights&quot; title=&quot;Legal or practical rights and freedoms relating to sex, reproduction, and reproductive health. The right to choose when and if to become a parent for ourselves or to become or remain pregnant or not are some kinds of reproductive rights.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;reproductive rights&lt;/a&gt; and the ramifications these frameworks can have on the lives of black women, people of color and their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;As a Latinx woman in the United States, I’ve had strong thoughts and feelings about the daily atrocities unfolding at the border. I’ve been plagued late at night with guilty thoughts and worry as I imagine what life is like for all the people making an attempt to immigrate to the U.S. right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;I’ve been withholding my opinions about immigration reform from people until now, mostly because I didn’t want to be a target of trolling. In my selfish attempt to “self-preserve,” I feel like my silence and my failure to protest injustice is a clear departure from my grandmother’s idea of what it means to be a proud of our Mexican roots. Worse yet, I feel like I’ve been defying her legacy of always fighting for justice and liberation despite the possibility or the reality of personal persecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;To continue that silence feel like an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#abuse&quot; title=&quot;Purposeful harm or mistreatment of another person, which can be verbal, emotional, physical or sexual. An ongoing pattern or cycle of such mistreatment or harm can characterize an abusive relationship.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;abuse&lt;/a&gt; of my privilege and my personal power to create change. It’s never been more clear to me that I need to reclaim my power and open myself up as a conduit in a position to uplift and amplify voices belonging to those who literally cannot speak out right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, mi gente — my beloved Latinx people who have courageously decided to make the trek north — your stories matter.&lt;/strong&gt; Please know I admire you and I respect your decision to take action in your own self-care and that of your families. Your decision demonstrates profound acts of self-love and self-preservation. May you travel safe and light, keeping your heads to the sky, for you belong to this land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;In the event you&#039;re reading this and are feeling resistance to my words of support and encouragement: I realize looking at this issue from my point of view may be somewhat difficult to understand, especially if you’ve been raised in a xenophobic environment. But trust me, the decision to leave a familiar land and head north into the unknown is not only brave, it is often the only choice a person has if they wish to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;This became profoundly apparent to me after reading countless stories covering immigration (like this one: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/politics/Undocumented-Women-Reproductive-Healthcare-Access-503062712.html&quot;&gt;Reproductive Healthcare Access Limited for Many Undocumented Women&lt;/a&gt;) and listening to a handful of podcasts interviews (like this one: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latinorebels.com/2019/06/21/genderviolencevzla/&quot;&gt;Gender Violence Against Venezuelan Refugees Near Colombian Border Is Worse Than Expected&lt;/a&gt;). These narratives that helped me better have given me a better understanding of &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; people throughout Latin America decide to migrate north in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;These stories shed light on the realities of extreme poverty, gang violence and violence specifically done to women and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#transgender&quot; title=&quot;Describes people who find that the gender applied to them because of the sex they were assigned at birth is incorrect.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;transgender&lt;/a&gt; people (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual_assault&quot; title=&quot;When someone is attacked, or attacks someone else, in a sexual way. Doing something sexual to someone who does not want that done to them, often by force or threat, or having something done to you sexually by someone else that is not wanted and/or which you have not consented to.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual assault&lt;/a&gt; and femicide) in countries including El Salvador, Honduras, Venezuela and Colombia. People aren’t coming to America to “take&quot; jobs and suck up federal resources. People are literally dying to get here; trying to stay alive and keep their families safe from harm. Any denial of that truth and irresponsible regurgitation of xenophobic rhetoric is not only uncompassionate, it’s downright dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;Below are links to a four-part series, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Undocumented and LGBTQ”&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;produced by &lt;a href=&quot;https://latinomediacollective.com/&quot;&gt;Latino Media Collective&lt;/a&gt;. Host Oscar Fernandez kicks off this series by reminding listeners that this is a very important topic to cover: the undocumented &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#LGBTQ&quot; title=&quot;L = lesbian, G = gay, B = bisexual, T = transgender, Q = queer or questioning. Additional letters sometimes added include U = unsure, I = intersex, P = pansexual, A= asexual, S = straight allies.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;LGBTQ&lt;/a&gt; migrant community is in fact one of the most marginalized sub-groups within a marginalized group of undocumented people. These are rare first-person narratives from highly ostracized migrants. Take a listen for yourself — each of the four conversations set out to address the central question: &lt;b&gt;“What is it like to be undocumented and LGBTQ+?” &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://latinomediacollective.com/2018/06/22/june-22nd-2018-undocumented-lgbtq/&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;- Features &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=@DagobertoBailon&quot;&gt;Dagoberto Bailon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/latsyrcrystal/&quot;&gt;Crystal Zaragoza&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/transqueerpueblo/&quot;&gt;Trans Queer Pueblo&lt;/a&gt;. This segment highlights immigration, deportation and sanctuary cities, liberation, and what it’s like for those who identify as “undocuqueer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://latinomediacollective.com/2018/11/30/nov-30th-2018-undocumented-lgbtq-pt-2/&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;- Oscar has a conversation with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebody.com/author/giuliani-alvarenga&quot;&gt;Guilani Alvarenga&lt;/a&gt;, an El Salvadorian journalist who covers all sorts of issues faced by the Latinx community. Guilani provides the fascinating backstory of the migrant caravan phenomena and how the LGBTQ community is fighting for their rights — both in the U.S. &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;in their native Central American communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://latinomediacollective.com/2019/03/15/march-15th-2019-undocumented-lgbtq-pt-3/&quot;&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt; - &lt;/b&gt;Oscar connects with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jennicetg&quot;&gt;Jennicet Gutierrez&lt;/a&gt;, trans activist and community organizer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://familiatqlm.org/&quot;&gt;Familia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement&lt;/a&gt;. Jennicet shares the backstory and death of Roxsana Hernandez, a trans woman who died in May of 2018 after being beaten while in ICE custody and experiencing grave complications due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#AIDS&quot; title=&quot;Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a very serious and often deadly disease of the immune system caused by HIV. AIDS itself can not be caught from another person, but those with AIDS have HIV, which is sexually transmissible. AIDS requires medical treatment.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Oscar and Maria discuss LGBTQ asylum seekers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cattrachas.org/index.php/es/&quot;&gt;Cattrachas&lt;/a&gt; and refuge which the LGBTQ migrants are finding at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_72&quot;&gt;La 72&lt;/a&gt;, a Mexican shelter in Tenosique, Tabasco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was a lot, my friends. My hope is that the very least any of us with privilege can do is to recognize that we owe it to those with less to educate ourselves, and to inform and elevate our empathy and compassion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In solidarity,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pride can be all kinds of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things Pride -- and other ways we can claim and stand up for space and visibility for ourselves and others as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#queer&quot; title=&quot;In the context of sexuality, a broad term for sexual orientation that can describe any number of orientations which are not heterosexual. People who identify as queer may be bisexual or pansexual, gay or lesbian, questioning, asexual or more. &quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;queer&lt;/a&gt; people, trans people, nonbinary people, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gay&quot; title=&quot;In the context of sexuality, a word for sexual orientation which either describes a man who is sexually and emotionally attracted to other men, or a person of any sex or gender who is sexually and emotionally attracted to people of the same or a similar sex or gender. Often used alongside lesbian.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#lesbian&quot; title=&quot;Describes the sexual orientation of a woman who is sexually and emotionally attracted only or mostly to other women.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;lesbian&lt;/a&gt; people; as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#pansexual&quot; title=&quot;Someone who may be/is attracted to other people of any gender or sex, not just men or women.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;pansexual&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#bisexual&quot; title=&quot;A term for sexual orientation which either describes a person who can be sexually and emotionally attracted to people of more than one gender.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;bisexual&lt;/a&gt;, omnisexual, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#asexual&quot; title=&quot;In the context of human sexuality, someone who either does not experience or has not yet experienced any sexual desires at all, or who has experienced/does experience sexual desires, but not a desire to enact them with other individuals.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;asexual&lt;/a&gt; people, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#intersex&quot; title=&quot;A socially constructed category that reflects real biological variation. Intersex  is a general term used to describe a variety of conditions where a person is born with reproductive and/or sexual anatomy that doesn’t seem to, or isn&amp;#039;t understood to, fit the typical definitions of female or male, and/or is born  a chromosomal combination other than XX or XY. Some intersex conditions are Turner Syndrome, Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, Klinefelter&amp;#039;s Syndrome, MRKH and Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;intersex&lt;/a&gt;, as questioning, and at and in all our intersections -- can be is &lt;strong&gt;positively disruptive&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m talking about what civil rights activist and United States Congressman John Lewis calls &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;good trouble&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;about upsetting the status quo in order to help quash oppression and forge the way for &lt;em&gt;expandin&lt;/em&gt;g freedom instead of removing or limiting it; for creating culturally and personally positive change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember a time not too long ago when we took an awful lot of crap around here, and encountered an awful lot of pushback -- even from some of our peers who are on board now -- when it came to queer, trans and otherwise non-heteronormative representation and inclusion in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; ed.  We faced some big-time resistance (and a great deal of harassment: we still do sometimes, unfortunately), for, for example, taking things like assumed and assigned &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender&quot; title=&quot;Characteristics that are seen or presented as distinguishing between male and female in a society. Gender may or may not include assigned or chosen: social roles, feelings, behaviors and/or presentation or appearance.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt; out of the way we talked about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual&quot; title=&quot;About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#anatomy&quot; title=&quot;The body, parts of the body, or physical structure of organisms like people, animals or plants.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;anatomy&lt;/a&gt;, or because we didn&#039;t segregate information for straight people and that which includes the rest of us, or even because I and others working with Scarleteen simply had the audacity (&lt;strong&gt;gasp!&lt;/strong&gt;) to be visibly out queer people providing sex education in the first place, and without leaving our queerness at the door, no less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I remember doing a radio interview in the early 2000s where they put some man on who accused me of providing sex education with the express purpose of &quot;turning young women gay.&quot; I assured him that despite a lot of very lonely queer people wishing hard for that kind of power on occasion since probably ever, none of us actually had it (and also that no one seemed to be working harder than straight men to try and turn women off of them, so maybe he wanted to go talk to his bretheren instead of me about that). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still plenty of people around like that or who still patently refuse to be inclusive or think that way. But all of those kinds of things are still far more accepted by far more people now, including some of the people or groups who didn&#039;t used to be accepting even just a few years back.  Pride and many other kinds of good trouble in the interest of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#QUILTBAG&quot; title=&quot;An acronym used to express the following sexual and gender identities/groups: Q: Queer and/or Questioning, U: Unidentified, I: Intersex, L: Lesbian, T: Transgender, B: Bisexual, A: Asexual (and/or) Allies, G: Gay and/or Genderqueer (GQ).&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;QUILTBAG&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#LGBTQ&quot; title=&quot;L = lesbian, G = gay, B = bisexual, T = transgender, Q = queer or questioning. Additional letters sometimes added include U = unsure, I = intersex, P = pansexual, A= asexual, S = straight allies.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;LGBTQ&lt;/a&gt; rights, visibility, love, community and plain old (but often hard-won) joy have helped us all move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By all means, fighting for your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/01/an-amazing-1969-account-of-the-stonewall-uprising/272467/&quot;&gt;mere right to be out and have community spaces&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-generation-z-is-making-sense-of-stonewalland-their-queer-selves&quot;&gt;Stonewall&lt;/a&gt; was very, very powerful good trouble.  I absolutely think that creating, providing and standing up for sex and relationships education and information that fully includes those of us who are queer and trans/gendernonconforming people is good trouble. I think, if you can, helping to organize something around or about Pride is good trouble.  Some of the musicians in this mix have made (and some still make!) good trouble by being visibly queer in music, both by disrupting that industry and by giving so many of us the ability to feel seen and heard just by turning on the radio (once-babyqueer-me will never ever be able to thank David Bowie, Boy George and Elton John enough). Over the years, some of our users have positively disrupted Scarleteen just by speaking up to us about something they needed or wanted or didn&#039;t think was as inclusive as it could have been, helping us adapt or change positively ourselves: today I&#039;m thinking particularly of both asexual and trans members of our community (thank you!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think attending a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teenvogue.com/story/history-of-pride-parades-in-the-us&quot;&gt;Pride event&lt;/a&gt;, if you can, and seeking out and taking in what you want from it that feels powerful and beneficial to you -- whether that&#039;s making yourself visible, finding community, celebrating your friends, hooking up, supporting your Mom, blending in without being visible to feel safe, presenting exactly how you want to for once, exploring identities -- can be good trouble. That&#039;s not just because when we participate or recognize Pride in some way we&#039;re acknowledging and honoring our elders and our ancestors who fought so hard to the great benefit those of us who came after, but that&#039;s absolutely part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pride parades or marches aren&#039;t for everybody, though. Some of the ways many of us participate in Pride simply aren&#039;t or aren&#039;t always accessible for everyone, whether that&#039;s about &lt;a href=&quot;https://rootedinrights.org/if-your-lgbtqia-pride-event-isnt-accessible-to-disabled-people-youre-missing-out/&quot;&gt;accessbility when it comes to disabililty&lt;/a&gt;, a lack of Pride within a community in the first place, personal safety, just not feeling ready to be so visible, or just not feeling very represented. (Elly Belle over at &lt;em&gt;Teen Vogue&lt;/em&gt; suggests &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teenvogue.com/story/how-to-celebrate-pride-if-you-dont-want-to-go-to-a-big-parade&quot;&gt;some great Pride alternatives&lt;/a&gt;, by the way.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m sorry if Pride events are something you really want to be for you but just aren&#039;t yet: I hope that&#039;s something that changes for you soon. But I also think that doing whatever we can to accept and celebrate ourselves, in any way, has the capacity to create powerful change, certainly for yourself, but also outside yourself, too.  I even think just&lt;em&gt; being&lt;/em&gt; queer, just &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; trans, just &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; nonconforming in any other way when it comes to the dominant paradigms du jour, just being who we are, not assimilating (as much as that works and is a match for what you actually want, anyway), even just holding our own space for yourself &lt;em&gt;by&lt;/em&gt; yourself makes a whole lot of good trouble. We don&#039;t often act the same ways when we don&#039;t accept ourselves as we do when we do: when we accept, affirm and celebrate ourselves for who we are, as we are, when we see ourselves with compassion and care and respect, I believe that flows out to everyone else, even if it seems small or subtle. Small, incremental changes are powerful, too, and they&#039;re also usually how bigger change happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Pride month is almost up, but before it&#039;s done -- even if Pride is just not your thing -- I hope you can find ways to disrupt some dominant heteronormative/&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#cisgender&quot; title=&quot;Describes people who have a gender identity which is traditionally thought to “match” their assigned sex. For instance, someone who was assigned male at birth who identifies as a man. Often used in relation to transgender.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;cisgender&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#binary&quot; title=&quot;Made up of two things or parts; a system with only two possible options or parts.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;binary&lt;/a&gt; paradigms, even if that&#039;s only with, for or within yourself. You&#039;re always a perfectly excellent place to start and to experience some positive, affirming, and powerful change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S. &lt;/strong&gt;My dog and occasionally self-assigned Scarleteen mascot Trouble Pants would like you all to know he is &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; good trouble, and if he can do it (most of the time), so apparently can you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you&#039;re going to pitch in with or start your own revolution, you&#039;re going to need some anthems. Sam, Alice M., Izzy, Jacob and I crafted you a mix this time that&#039;s full of good trouble and we hope will power you up in all the best ways.  Check it out on &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/scarleteen-mix-10-pride/pl.u-BY3RtX2qRW&quot;&gt;Apple Music&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0ygKTsc8jWuWdZ21oY7nUY&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happy, happy, happy Pride, everyone!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sexuality in Color: Some Reproductive Justice Heroes</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/chant%C3%A9_thurmond/sexuality_in_color_some_reproductive_justice_heroes</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;sexuality in color&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/incolor.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: right; width: 234px; height: 166px;&quot; /&gt;Alright friends, this week I’m here to address one thing and one thing only: the obtrusive attempts being made to &lt;b&gt;restrict people’s access to affordable and safe &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#abortion&quot; title=&quot;A procedure to intentionally end a pregnancy before a birth. Miscarriage is also sometimes called &amp;quot;spontaneous abortion,&amp;quot; even though it is usually not intended.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt; care throughout the United States. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;I have direct experience working in reproductive health and a lot of comfort understanding and navigating policy, but even I am feeling overwhelmed and confused by all of what’s been going on and how it’s being reported. And frankly, my worry is that if this is possible for someone with a lot of personal and professional experience in this arena, what&#039;s happening for those who aren’t familiar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;In case you’ve lost track of what’s transpired over the last several weeks, we now have at least nine states in the United States where policy makers are putting in overtime in an effort to rollback rights, limit access to abortion and resources for abortion care. For some basics, check out this NPR article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/06/05/729753903/early-abortion-bans-which-states-have-passed-them&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Early Abortion Bans: Which States Have Passed Them?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Unfortunately for those of us working to expand access and resources to safe abortion care, the attempt of political conservatives to regress and reinstate paternalistic oppression doesn’t seem to be going away anytime soon, if ever. But there’s also been some good news, not just worldwide -- like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/africa/kenya-s-rape-survivors-win-right-to-abortion-in-landmark-court-ruling-1.3923736&quot;&gt;rape survivors in Kenya winning the right to abortion in a landmark court ruling&lt;/a&gt;! -- but stateside.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/6/12/18662738/abortion-bill-illinois-maine-news-laws-roe&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;While Some States Try to Ban Abortion, These States Are Expanding Access&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and have all signed laws that will protect and expand reproductive care in the coming months. Take the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu-il.org/en/legislation/sb-25-Illinois-reproductive-health-act&quot;&gt;Illinois Reproductive Health Act&lt;/a&gt; for example, a series of provisions just signed into law by Governor JB Pritzker last week, which will provide unprecedented access to reproductive health and abortion care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;There are a number of ways we can virtually hold space and support each other in both the good news and the terrible. My contribution for today is the following list of diverse and trustworthy voices on the frontlines of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#reproductive_rights&quot; title=&quot;Legal or practical rights and freedoms relating to sex, reproduction, and reproductive health. The right to choose when and if to become a parent for ourselves or to become or remain pregnant or not are some kinds of reproductive rights.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;reproductive rights&lt;/a&gt; and justice that speak to me. May you find some support and comfort in at least one of the these resources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;li1&quot;&gt;• If you have to start with one organization, I think the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://abortionfunds.org/abortion-funds-101/&quot;&gt;National Network of Abortion Funds (NNAF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is the one. NNAF is an established organization (they just celebrated their 25th anniversary last fall) made up of a network of 70+ organizations throughout the U.S. working diligently to remove barriers to abortion and reproductive healthcare. NNAF is fully committed to helping people, especially the most marginalized and most directly affected by barriers to abortion access. Their organizing is strongly centered around the intersections of racial, economic and reproductive justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;At the helm of NNAF is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yamaniyansa.com&quot;&gt;Yamani Hernandez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; their Executive Director, who does an amazing job curating culturally relevant and timely information (I especially enjoy following along via Twitter). Yamani is highly respected throughout the reproductive justice (RJ) community and has earned a reputation for being a fierce advocate and eloquent storyteller who&#039;s able to inspire people to take swift action. If you’re looking for a voice you can trust who has an intersectional lens and always up-to-date on the latest and greatest regarding abortion and reproductive justice, look no further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Here’s a recent interview feautring Yamani,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://truthout.org/articles/the-auntie-network-already-exists/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The &quot;Auntie Network&quot; Already Exists&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where they propose a simple call to action: &lt;b&gt;if you want to get involved, do your best to join existing efforts rather than trying to reinvent the wheel.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;• Since we’re already talking about NNAF, I encourage you to also check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://wetestify.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;We Testify&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative sponsored by NNAF that expands the spectrum of abortion storytellers in the public sphere with the goal of helping people understand the complexity of navigating safe abortion care. This project reminds us that no two stories are alike and that the needs associated with abortion care are as diverse as the people who need services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;• Speaking of abortion stories, I’d like to highlight this abortion story throwback featuring &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jackquemi&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jack Qu’emi Gutiérrez&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a trans and GNC Afro-Latinx &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#femme&quot; title=&quot;Describes a person who is intentionally feminine in appearance, behavior, dress, identity or sexual attitude. Often used in relation to butch. Most often used in the LGBT community, but can refer to people of any orientation.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;femme&lt;/a&gt; who decided to share their own story in an effort to advocate for nonbinary abortion access. This was originally produced by All Access Coalition back in 2016 and was shared by the Editors of Everyday Feminism in this&lt;a href=&quot;https://everydayfeminism.com/2016/09/non-binary-abortion-access/&quot;&gt; post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;The acknowledgment of diverse voices and leaders in Reproductive Justice wouldn’t be possible without the one and only &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lorettaross.com&quot;&gt;Loretta Ross&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, cofounder and former National Coordinator of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sistersong.net/&quot;&gt;SisterSong&lt;/a&gt;. Loretta is a renowned RJ pioneer and leader who’s played a significant role in advancing an inclusive agenda reflective of the diverse needs of Black women and people of color whose narratives, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.populationconnection.org/article/loretta-ross/&quot;&gt;according to Ross&lt;/a&gt;, were not often reflected in the original feminist movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Loretta is currently a Visiting Professor of Practice in the School of Social Transformation at Arizona State University where she teaches &quot;Reproductive Justice Theory and Practice&quot; and &quot;Race and Culture in the U.S.&quot; While she may no longer be at SisterSong, she leaves a behind a lasting legacy that will forever be inspired by her tenacity and commitment to inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;If you’re unfamiliar with Loretta Ross or the RJ framework as a whole, it’d be worth your time to start with a few of her presentations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;ul1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRcT_NMa6aI&amp;amp;t=7s&quot;&gt;Reproductive Justice 101 (part 1)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNIWbvdeJas&amp;amp;t=9s&quot;&gt;Reproductive Justice 101 (part 2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYDytm45ZXw&amp;amp;t=1074s&quot;&gt;Reproductive Injustice, White Supremacy and Feminist Strategies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Another organization uplifting women, nonbinary and Indigenous people of color and their families is &lt;a href=&quot;https://forwardtogether.org&quot;&gt;Forward Together&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;This 30-year-old organization has prioritized helping people access to healthcare (including abortion care), family recognition and safe communities. They also lead the &lt;a href=&quot;https://forwardtogether.org/programs/strong-families-network/&quot;&gt;Strong Families Network&lt;/a&gt;, which is home to over 200 local, state and national organizations committed to ensuring that all families have the rights, resources and recognition they need to grow and thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;• Last, but certainly not least...I’ve got the perfect &lt;b&gt;TL;DR&lt;/b&gt; resource for anyone who is short on time or simply experiencing information overload: this&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.womenhaveoptions.org/decolonize_your_feminism&quot;&gt;Self-Reflection Syllabus to Decolonize Your Feminism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;an amazing essential reading list compiled by National Network of Abortion Funds (NNAF) that can help get you more familiar with RJ in a jiffy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;This list is in no way fully comprehensive, but I think it’s got some really good places to start.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;I encourage you to explore their websites and follow them on social media!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;In solidarity,&lt;br /&gt;
Chanté&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sexuality in Color: Two Amazing Pleasure and Radical Self-Love Teachers</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/chant%C3%A9_thurmond/sexuality_in_color_two_amazing_pleasure_and_radical_selflove_teachers</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;sexuality in color blog&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/incolor.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: right; width: 234px; height: 166px;&quot; /&gt;It’s Chanté, back with more sexuality (in color) and intersectionality. If you appreciated last week’s definitions but are still curious or you want to learn even more, you may also find &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWeDatP0cv4&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; from Taryn Crenshaw helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Today I’m eager to dive into something that is fresh in my mind: pleasure, body-positivity, self-love and self-acceptance. These are concepts that are important for people of all ages to explore, especially if you’re actively navigating and shaping your own &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#identity&quot; title=&quot;The defining character or personality of an individual; who we feel like we are as a person. Identity is often used to talk about sexual identity -- who we are as sexual people, which can include things like our sexual orientation, our preferences and things we like and want in sex and sexuality, our sexual politics -- or gender identity, who we feel we are and identify as (even if only to ourselves) in terms of our gender.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;identity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;Pleasure and Radical Self-Love&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Last Friday, Heather invited me to attend an event (at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.womenandchildrenfirst.com/&quot;&gt;Women and Children First&lt;/a&gt;!) with them, a reading by and discussion with the renowned &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://adriennemareebrown.net&quot;&gt;adrienne maree brown&lt;/a&gt; -- Black &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#queer&quot; title=&quot;In the context of sexuality, a broad term for sexual orientation that can describe any number of orientations which are not heterosexual. People who identify as queer may be bisexual or pansexual, gay or lesbian, questioning, asexual or more. &quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;queer&lt;/a&gt; feminist, pleasure activist, healer/doula and author -- who’s got a new book out, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Pleasure-Activism-Politics-Emergent-Strategy/dp/1849353263/ref=pd_bxgy_14_2/145-2745509-2171307?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;pd_rd_i=1849353263&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=12b900b7-7066-11e9-8561-7333deb843e8&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=3uwcb&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=SjmbG&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=a2006322-0bc0-4db9-a08e-d168c18ce6f0&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=R3GP38HN95TYWQ2XXFKA&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;refRID=R3GP38HN95TYWQ2XXFKA&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pleasure Activism: The Politics of Feeling Good&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. While I was aware of the breadth and depth of her work, I didn’t know much about her personal backstory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;All of that changed after last week, because during her event she referenced being a Virgo (no wonder she’s so damn cool!) and briefly touched on a variety of complex, multi-layered topics like somatic healing, metaphysics, astrology, yoga and self-love. These are all things I love learning and talking about so I felt as though I found a long-lost soul sister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Watching and listening to adrienne live was such a treat! She has an amazing voice, vibrant energy and a great read on people. During the Q&amp;amp;A, someone asked a question about how to become more open and attracted to people we aren’t normally attracted to. adrienne dove into her thoughts about &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;decolonizing our fantasies and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#desire&quot; title=&quot;A feeling of strongly wanting something. In the context of sex, desire can be a strong feeling of a physical and psychological want for any kind of sex.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;desire&lt;/a&gt; -- &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;f&lt;i&gt;or more details on that, check out her blog post about the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://adriennemareebrown.net/2014/02/12/wherein-i-write-about-sex-5-tangible-tools-of-a-pleasure-activist/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;5 tangible tools of a pleasure activist.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;This is&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;something I think we should all being doing as an act of reprogramming ourselves to be more inclusive and open our minds to new possibilities of what it means to be desirable, respectable, or successful. The more I thought about it, the more excited I got about this, and I hope to explore it further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;I could go on and on about her, but instead, I think this is an appropriate place to pause, share some links to more of adrienne’s work, and let her self-represent. For those who are just discovering adrienne and her brilliant work, I recommend these items below that showcase her personality and her emergent framework:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;ul1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;First things first -- if you’re not following adrienne on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/adriennemaree&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/adriennemareebrown/&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;b&gt;@adriennemaree&lt;/b&gt;) you may want to start there! Her content is diverse, informative and intriguing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;Her website is full of a lot of great things! Speaking of which, she wrote a post about &lt;a href=&quot;http://adriennemareebrown.net/2019/04/20/unapologetic-lazarusing-the-sacred-work-of-beyonce-and-lizzo&quot;&gt;Beyonce and Lizzo&lt;/a&gt;! (Me too!) If you’d like to read mine, it’s right &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog/chant%2525C3%2525A9_thurmond/sexuality_in_color_of_queens_and_bs&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;Since I failed to record a clip from last Friday’s event, I found a substitute: here’s a recent interview of adrienne featured on &lt;a href=&quot;http://forthewild.world/listen/adrienne-maree-brown-on-pleasure-as-birthright115&quot;&gt;For The Wild&lt;/a&gt; podcast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;adrienne and her sister, Autumn, who seems to be just as talented, co-host a podcast (together) called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.endoftheworldshow.org/&quot;&gt;How to Survive the End of the World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;Here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-sCy8SzvHY&quot;&gt;YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; of adrienne in 2017, talking about her first book, &lt;i&gt;Emergent Strategy&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li2&quot;&gt;Learn about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alliedmedia.org/esii/story&quot;&gt;Emergent Strategy Ideation Institute&lt;/a&gt;, an organization founded by adrienne that&#039;s based in Detroit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p5&quot;&gt;A&lt;strong&gt;nother intersectional powerhouse to add to your list of badasses is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sonyareneetaylor.com/&quot;&gt;Sonya Renee Taylor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; She&#039;s the Founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebodyisnotanapology.com/&quot;&gt;The Body Is Not An Apology&lt;/a&gt; -- an amazing digital hub where folx can find plenty of content about &lt;i&gt;“radical self-love for everybody and every body.&quot; &lt;/i&gt;Sonya is an unapologetic, radical self-love enthusiast; a disability and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#social_justice&quot; title=&quot;An equitable distribution of advantages, assets, and benefits among all members of a society.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;social justice&lt;/a&gt; activist and an artist who boldly shares her rendition of life — being Black, a queer woman, growing up in a military family, being a child of the 80’s crack epidemic, and her experience coping with clinical depression. Here are a few places where you can start exploring Sonya and her work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;ul1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li7&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.colorlines.com/articles/5-tools-radical-self-love-valentines-day&quot;&gt;5 Tools for Radical Self-Love on Valentine’s Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.colorlines.com/writers/miriam-zoila-p%2525C3%2525A9rez&quot;&gt;Miriam Zoila Pérez&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/miriamzperez&quot;&gt;@MiriamZPerez&lt;/a&gt;) -- a very talented Cuban-American writer, doula and podcaster who runs &lt;a href=&quot;http://radicaldoula.com/&quot;&gt;RadicalDoulas.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li6&quot;&gt;For a long(er) and more in-depth look into her backstory, I highly recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/sonya-renee-taylor-bitch-interview&quot;&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt; of Sonya with Bitch Media’s Editor-in-Chief, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bitchmedia.org/profile/evette-dione&quot;&gt;Evette Dionne&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/freeblackgirl&quot;&gt;@freeblackgir&lt;/a&gt;l).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li6&quot;&gt;For the full (bodied) manifesto on these topics, I recommend grabbing a copy of Sonya’s must-read book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Body-Not-Apology-Radical-Self-Love/dp/1626569762&quot;&gt;The Body Is Not an Apology: The Power of Radical Self-Love&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;li6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wd9OQdu2wUI&quot;&gt;Here’s&lt;/a&gt; Sonya giving a keynote speech earlier this spring at &lt;i&gt;The UGA College of Education’s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Annual Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Conference.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;li6&quot;&gt;One of many quotable quotes she dropped during this event:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;p10&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The reality is we are &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; a list of things. A list of intersections of identities that converge with each other, that compliment each other, that contradict each other; that either give us access to privilege in the world or give us access to oppression in the world. And without actually raising to our consciousness these intersections, then we don’t actually have an opportunity to create a world that facilitates our ability to live wholly at these intersections.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;My hope is that the more I explore intersectionality as a foundation to identity, the more you might too. Here’s to more pleasure, more body-positivity, more self-acceptance and more self-love for all of us. May we all come to know and embody these qualities a little more each day.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sexuality in Color: Of Queens and Bs</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/chant%C3%A9_thurmond/sexuality_in_color_of_queens_and_bs</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/incolor.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: right; width: 234px; height: 166px;&quot; /&gt;Hey, hey, hey, it’s Chanté, back this week to continue the convo about sexuality and intersectionality. This week, I want to revisit a little basic terminology I brought up last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/bodies/sexuality_wtf_is_it_anyway&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sexuality&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;and&lt;b&gt; intersectionality&lt;/b&gt; are my jam. Why? Well, because I’m someone who identifies as so many things that talking about &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; without intersectionality seems literally impossible. I think the more we can connect the two, the easier it may be to see the fluidity in and the intersections within our own identities and those of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;If any of that’s brand-new to you, you might want to check out some content on our site about it (from awesome Scarleteen team members Al and Jacob, no less), to get yourself started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;ul1&quot;&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/intersectionality_part_3_a_personal_take&quot;&gt;Intersectionaltiy Part 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To read &lt;a href=&quot;http://aapf.org/kimberle-crenshaw&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kimberle Crenshaw&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s version — the woman who coined the term — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/lifestyle/2014/04/kimberl-crenshaw-intersectionality-i-wanted-come-everyday-metaphor-anyone-could&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;p6&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Current Mood: #GetMeBodied&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;There are two Queens I need to holler at and give all the praise to right now for reminding the entire (digital) world that &lt;b&gt;BLACK IS BEAUTIFUL&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p7&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i&gt;drum roll, please…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;#1) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beyonce.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beyoncé.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;I got three words: &lt;b&gt;SHE DID THAT&lt;/b&gt;. On second thought, I have three &lt;i&gt;slightly &lt;/i&gt;better words: &lt;b&gt;Get Me Bodied! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Once again, Queen B broke the damn internet when she dropped &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/81013626&quot;&gt;Homecoming&lt;/a&gt; via Netflix last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Of course, I stayed up way past my bedtime to attend her digital concert! &lt;b&gt;Nothing &lt;/b&gt;(not even my kids waking up and demanding I turn down the TV) was going to stop me from singing, dancing and scrolling through my amazing social media feeds. I stayed up until 4 AM that night -- or day rather -- because I knew it was about to be LIT. The beautiful folx of Twitter and Instagram did not disappoint! &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p9&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;In case you missed it, I highly recommend starting &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/patricepeck/beyonce-homecoming-black-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;here.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; This gem is brought to us by &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/patricepeck&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Patrice Peck&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, talented Buzzfeed writer who is has been doing a damn good job of covering all things: #blackgirlmagic, culture and technology. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Anyway, Beyoncé and her crew made me feel &lt;b&gt;all the feels&lt;/b&gt;. I laughed, danced, cried and contemplated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;What I loved most was the intimacy of her commentary; it was powerful and poetic. I sincerely appreciated her attention to the details -- everything from the conscious curation (of black artists, performers, dancers, drummers) to Nina Simone’s voiceovers to Beyoncé sharing intimate details about her journey of coming HOME to herself after being pregnant with twins and surviving an emergency c-section. If there’s anyone who understands, I certainly do. Like Bey, I am a proud mommy of twins and went through a similar experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Since becoming mother of two highly active little kids, I’ve learned just how much of a sacrifice it can be to 1) conceive 2) grow and 3) raise children. It is NOT for the faint of heart. But as much as I like to joke and tell everyone that Beyoncé and are soul sisters (our names rhyme; we’re both Virgos who happened to be born in the same zip code; both have twins AND we share common interests in wanting to empower and educate urban youth within our communities.), the two of us live different realities and lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of that, I wasn’t expecting a woman of her stature -- and especially because she has set a precedent: her personal life is off limits -- to blatantly share the fact that she weighed 218 pounds the day she gave birth. I also wasn’t expecting Queen B to spill the tea when it came to experiencing complications or misgivings she had about headlining at Coachella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Ya’ll, this was a big deal to me because she’s built a brand that is&lt;b&gt; iron clad&lt;/b&gt;. I can’t really think of a time where she’s folded OR subjected herself to being explicitly vulnerable. So when she shared such intimate details, I felt like I could FINALLY see more of myself in her. My respect and admiration for her grew tenfold this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Her story reminded me, and the world, that black is &lt;b&gt;beautiful&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;radiant.&lt;/b&gt; The glimpses into their family life was exactly what my soul had been yearning for. I loved seeing Jay Z in the background tending to their children while she worked her ass off for this comeback moment. His presence conveyed a strong message; black love and black excellence isn’t about being “Instagram perfect”. It’s about showing up and tending to your tribe. Sometimes it means taking a step back from your own spotlight to make space for your partner’s evolution and homecoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;Now that she’s home, I can only hope this is the beginning of a new era; one where we start to experience more of the &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; Beyoncé and as a result, recognize the Queen in ourselves. Thank you, Beyoncé, you are the G.O.A.T.!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p4&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cuziloveyou.lizzomusic.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lizzo.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Need I say more? &lt;/b&gt;Maybe not, but I will; she’s Black. Beautiful. Thicc. Sultry. Confident and my (new) Queen of Body Positivity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lizzo went mainstream when she dropped a masterpiece last month -- her album, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuz_I_Love_You&quot;&gt;Cuz I Love You&lt;/a&gt;, which quickly climbed the charts and proved to the world that black beauty is not objective, it’s subjective. &lt;b&gt;YAAAS GURL! We see you and we LOVE you. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favorite Lizzo quotes -- keep reading if you want to learn how a queen builds herself up and practices self-love:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;p10&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;First off, I love my body. No matter what angle you shoot it at, no matter the lighting, my body is just so fucking beautiful all the time. I may talk shit about it sometimes, but fuck. She’s still a bad bitch,&quot; she explained. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p10&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;My second favorite thing about myself is my blackness. I am really just so honored to be graced with this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#identity&quot; title=&quot;The defining character or personality of an individual; who we feel like we are as a person. Identity is often used to talk about sexual identity -- who we are as sexual people, which can include things like our sexual orientation, our preferences and things we like and want in sex and sexuality, our sexual politics -- or gender identity, who we feel we are and identify as (even if only to ourselves) in terms of our gender.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;identity&lt;/a&gt;. No shade to any other shade on the planet—I just can’t relate. I just love being a black woman, even in a world where [we] are statistically the least desirable. I am still here, and I still rise.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;I discovered this awesome website last month (I know, I’m late!) and have to share with all of you - if you haven’t spent time scoping out the stories and content on&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shondaland.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ShondaLand&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I implore you to do so now!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>A Quick and Easy Guide to Queer and Trans Identities is THE DREAMIEST.</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/a_quick_and_easy_guide_to_queer_and_trans_identities_is_the_dreamiest</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;cover of a quick and easy guide to queer and trans identities&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/coverqati.png&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: right; width: 350px; height: 494px;&quot; /&gt;We got our collective, grabby little hands on a copy of Mady G. and J.R. Zuckerberg&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/A-Quick-Easy-Guide-to-Queer-Trans-Identities/Mady-G/9781620105863&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Quick and Easy Guide to Queer and Trans Identities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a couple weeks ago and we&#039;re in luuuuurrrve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just came out this week, so we&#039;re here to tell you that we think you -- especially if there are some young people in your life you can share it with -- should get your hands on a copy, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it? &lt;/strong&gt; This 100+ page book is a trippy, cuddly and affirming comic adventure that very warmly, gently and with great joy leads the reader through a wide range of identities and some parts of life that are often about or involve them, like intimate relationships, dysphoria, coming out, making decisions about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender_expression&quot; title=&quot;The way people externally communicate gender identity to others through their behavior and their outward, chosen appearance.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender expression&lt;/a&gt; and our bodies, including medical decisions, finding -- and feeling without -- community and support. It&#039;s something that takes some subjects that can be really scary for people, especially for many queer and trans young people, and that I think could help turn a lot of that fear or dread into understanding, acceptance and happy celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s amazing and wonderful and just the very sweetest thing, is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&#039;s going to be a goodie for just about everyone: whether you don&#039;t know jack about any of this, or whether all of this is very much about you and you know a lot from lived experience, a million awesome queer or trans history internet rabbit holes, and other ways of learning. This is potentially for you if you feel pretty comfortable, perhaps even deeply at home, with these arenas and ways of being, or if you are feeling intimidated, lost and uncomfortable (the sheer delight in all of this will help, I promise). For those who don&#039;t yet or currently have any queer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#asexual&quot; title=&quot;In the context of human sexuality, someone who either does not experience or has not yet experienced any sexual desires at all, or who has experienced/does experience sexual desires, but not a desire to enact them with other individuals.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;asexual&lt;/a&gt;, trans, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#genderqueer&quot; title=&quot;Describes someone whose chosen gender identity is neither masculine nor feminine, is between or beyond genders, which rejects binary gender, or which is some combination of genders.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;genderqueer&lt;/a&gt; or nonbinary community, this can provide some of that feeling.  I think this book would be a great choice for teen readers, including young teens.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;internal page of a quick and easy guide to queer and trans identities featuring sproutlings!&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/qati_2.png&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; margin: 10px; float: left; width: 350px; height: 505px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are talking snails! There are Sproutlings (you&#039;ll see)! There&#039;s even a Julia Serano cameo! There&#039;s some dorktastically cool extras in the back. There are soft and lovely colors and beautiful patterns. There are excellent definitions and descriptions and talk-throughs and other helps for understanding concepts that can really get people twisted sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s oodles of mad affirmation, bigging up and support. This is a comic full of wisdom, full of whimsy, and really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; full of love. I&#039;m completely over the moon for it. It&#039;s my new most favorite thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here&#039;s what some of the rest of our team had to say about it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Al:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really, really loved this. I loved how in-depth it went into things that I tend to see covered a lot less (asexuality, dysphoria, the challenges of coming out). I really liked the Sproutlings, especially in light of their creator&#039;s comments about imagining an idyllic world that truly does allow for infinite diversity where the rules aren&#039;t quite so strict and the answer is almost always &quot;Sounds good! Thank you for telling me! I love and accept you!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I lightly wept when I read the nonbinary-alien part: I can&#039;t tell you how many times I&#039;ve felt like an alien in my own skin. I refer to myself as a frog a lot precisely because of how the things that make me feel different from the people around me (read: brown, fat, hairy, genderqueer and generally odd) might feel more okay if I was amphibious. And I&#039;m at least a few years older than the average &quot;queer youth,&quot; so I can say that I&#039;ve 100% experienced that feeling, and that it&#039;s spot on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;internal page of a quick and easy guide to queer and trans identities featuring snails!&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/qati_1.png&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: right; width: 350px; height: 371px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mo:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am really impressed at how it manages to present concepts in a pretty nuanced way without feeling too heavy or overwhelming for people who may be unfamiliar with what&#039;s being discussed. The art is fun and cute without feeling *cutesy* and has a great energy to it; there&#039;s such a great loving and celebratory vibe through the entire book. I think this will be a really helpful resource for people who are questioning or just starting to explore their queer identities and for allies who want to educate themselves; this is absolutely the sort of thing I wish I&#039;d had oh...17 years ago when I was first starting to understand my own queerness and had a lot of questions and not many places to turn for answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jacob:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is so beautiful!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sam:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love how casual the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#identity&quot; title=&quot;The defining character or personality of an individual; who we feel like we are as a person. Identity is often used to talk about sexual identity -- who we are as sexual people, which can include things like our sexual orientation, our preferences and things we like and want in sex and sexuality, our sexual politics -- or gender identity, who we feel we are and identify as (even if only to ourselves) in terms of our gender.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;identity&lt;/a&gt; sections are. They do a great job of hitting all the key points without feeling preachy. Also, the reaction the snails have to seeing all the queer humans for the first time is not unlike how I felt the first time I went to a Pride event, and I love seeing that idea that the diversity of queer presentations is something worthy of joy and wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#relationship&quot; title=&quot;Some kind of ongoing interaction or association with another person, place or thing.

There are all kinds of relationships: family relationships, friendships, romantic relationships, and sexual relationships. Sometimes there is an overlap where we have more than one kind of relationship with someone. Sometimes people use the word relationship to only mean a romantic, &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot;, or committed relationship, even though that&amp;#039;s not all this word means.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;relationship&lt;/a&gt; section is really strong. I could see it becoming something educators use. The prose and drawings communicate the realities of healthy and unhealthy relationships in a way that&#039;s going to be accessible to a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That link way up top to Simon and Schuster&#039;s page for this book has a handful of links to places where you can buy it. We also want to make sure you don&#039;t forget you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.womenandchildrenfirst.com/book/9781620105863&quot;&gt;get it at our favorite local feminist bookstore&lt;/a&gt; (the endlessly amazing and resilient &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.womenandchildrenfirst.com&quot;&gt;Women and Children First&lt;/a&gt;), too!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Scarleteen Mix #9: Crushing It!</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/scarleteen_mix_9_crushing_it</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;scarleteen mix # 8: strut your stuff (image of a a kickass pink flamingo totally feeling himself!)&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/Scarleteen%20Mixes%20%282%29_0.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 400px; height: 400px; margin: 10px; float: right;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, people writing into Scarleteen have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/advice/i%E2%80%99m_having_sex_fantasies_about_my_crush&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/advice/my_best_friend_just_came_out_to_me_but_i_was_in_love_with_him&quot;&gt;lot&lt;/a&gt; of questions about all &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/advice/im_a_bisexual_girl_with_a_great_boyfriend_and_a_bunch_of_guilt&quot;&gt;kinds&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/advice/two_probablynotsogreat_pursuits&quot;&gt;crushing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/relationships/im_a_gay_guy_but_theres_this_girl&quot;&gt;crushes&lt;/a&gt;. Concerns about crushes have included all you&#039;d expect: like worries about rejection if a crush is being pursued -- and all the usual, dizzying do-I-or-don&#039;t-I? -- worries about crush-discovery with an iffy-crush, or when crushes put someone outside heterosexuality; how to make decisions while you&#039;re under the influence of a crush. There&#039;s been crushes on friends, teachers, dudes on the bus, that &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; girl, someone&#039;s brother -- awkward -- someone else&#039;s girlfriend (dammit), even on someone else&#039;s persona. There&#039;ve been so many worries that this delightful-but-also-agonizing feeling might never end or even just give you five minutes of peace ever again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What even IS a crush?&lt;/strong&gt; I think crushes can be like what some people say about being in love or about porn or about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#orgasm&quot; title=&quot;An event typically in response to physical or intellectual sexual stimulation, controlled by the involuntary nervous system. Orgasm often results in muscle contractions in and around the genitals, other muscular spasms throughout the body, and a feeling of sexual and/or tension release.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;orgasm&lt;/a&gt;: kind of hard to define, but you&#039;ll probably know it when you feel it. There&#039;s more than one kind of crush -- there&#039;s the lusty-lovey kind, but also just the lusty kind &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; just the lovey kind, but THEN there&#039;s also friend crushes, I-want-to-be-as-cool-as-they-are crushes, parent crushes, pet crushes, crushes on someone&#039;s creative work and so many more AND then crushes that are more than one kind at once! There&#039;s certainly more than one way of feeling when a person has a crush or is crushed on, and goodness knows there are a million different contexts in which we all experience crushes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most generally, I just define crushes as a strong -- usually &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; strong -- interest in, or attraction to, someone (or some&lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt;), and usually someone you&#039;re not already super-involved with or close to. I&#039;d personally say that a lot of what limerence, or new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#relationship&quot; title=&quot;Some kind of ongoing interaction or association with another person, place or thing.

There are all kinds of relationships: family relationships, friendships, romantic relationships, and sexual relationships. Sometimes there is an overlap where we have more than one kind of relationship with someone. Sometimes people use the word relationship to only mean a romantic, &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot;, or committed relationship, even though that&amp;#039;s not all this word means.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;relationship&lt;/a&gt; energy is, are people with a mutual crush who are now connecting. (Shazam! SUPERCRUSH POWERS ACTIVATE!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m someone who tends to identify what a crush is or isn&#039;t for &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, though, by how I&#039;m feeling: totally distracted, no matter how hard I try to focus on something else? Check. Feeling like my whole emotional center of gravity has gone all pear-shaped? Check. Finding that my thoughts seem to have a very singular focus? A singular focus I seem to keep making everything else about? A singular focus my friends might maybe be getting really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; sick of hearing about? Eeyup. Listening to some music, sometimes on endless repeat, that makes not-crushing-me cringe and crushing-me swoon? You know it. When was the last time that I went a whole day, or even a whole hour, without thinking abou--- oh dear. Yep. I&#039;m crushing out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news and the bad news for all of us is that crushes -- or at least the initial intensity of them -- are usually temporary. We won&#039;t always feel that way, which, in my mind, is pretty equal parts bummer and massive relief. But whatever does or doesn&#039;t come of crushes, whatever their shape or size, and however long they hang around for, it can be amazing and life-affirming to just let yourself fully experience the way they feel and go with it for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want some crush-based or crush-adjacent bits to read, might I suggest:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If you&#039;re trying to decide what to do about a crush, you might be considering something that carries some risks, even just to your pride.  That might even have you backing off when you&#039;d actually really like to pursue something that could be potentially good, and when it&#039;d be good for you to take a positive risk.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/etc/risky_business_learning_to_consider_risk_and_make_sound_sexual_choices&quot;&gt;Risky Business: Learning to Consider Risk and Make Sound Sexual Choices&lt;/a&gt; can give you some help if you need it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If things with a crush can get sexual, it can be really easy to get carried away with ourselves, so, just in case: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/relationships/whoa_there_how_to_slow_down_when_youre_moving_too_fast&quot;&gt;Whoa, There! How to Slow Down When You&#039;re Moving Too Fast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/abuse_assault/safer_sexfor_your_heart&quot;&gt;Safer Sex...for Your Heart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the event a crush becomes a relationship, two great places to start here to get some basic information to help you start intimate relationships on the right foot are: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/abuse_assault/hello_sailor_how_to_build_board_and_navigate_a_healthy_relationship&quot;&gt;Hello, Sailor! How to Build, Board and Navigate a Healthy Relationship&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/relationships/supermodel_creating_nurturing_your_own_best_relationship_models&quot;&gt;Supermodel: Creating &amp;amp; Nurturing Your Own Best Relationship Models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If things could get potentially domestic while you&#039;re in the throes of a crush, gawd help you, you may want the sage counsel of a few friends and a copy of this: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/etc/you_them_and_a_uhaul_considering_cohabitation&quot;&gt;You, Them and a U-Haul: Considering Cohabitation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you now or have you ever been floating and gooey or jangly and excited or blissed out or feeling downright tortured or just plain imploding from the giant wave of &lt;i&gt;what even are all these freakishly distracting feelings&lt;/i&gt;? There&#039;s a song here for that: even if you haven&#039;t ever had a crush before you just might wind up feeling like you have one now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This theme was super popular with our staff! Joining me this time around were Alice O., Alice M., Jacob, Siân, Chanté, Sam, Ruby and Al! You can turn it up and crush on it with us&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;on &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/playlist/scarleteen-mix-9-crushing-it/pl.u-6akZIk6mKy&quot;&gt;Apple Music&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4eRPMFfMmSwnFP5D7hWTrf?si=gO9zrpfsRK2OmQcRUpsq6g&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Hey, Hey, it&#039;s Chanté, the new curator for Sexuality in Color!</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/chant%C3%A9_thurmond/hey_hey_its_chant%C3%A9_the_new_curator_for%C2%A0sexuality_in_color</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;sexuality in color: writing outside the lines at scarleteen (abstract image)&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/incolor.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: right; width: 234px; height: 166px;&quot; /&gt;Hey! I&#039;m Chanté Thurmond, and I&#039;m the new curator of the &lt;b&gt;Sexuality in Color &lt;/b&gt;blog, as well as Scarleteen&#039;s Growth and Advancement Advisor. Before I share a quote that&#039;s been in my heart lately, and a shortlist of a few exceptional PoC who consistently add value to the culture and to their respective communities, I want to share a brief backstory about my journey to Scarleteen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, I had the great fortune of meeting (and befriending) the infamous Heather Corinna, Scarleteen&#039;s founder, at an annual Teenwise conference in the Twin Cities. We became instant pals -- the two of us bonded over our shared passion and commitment to working in partnership with young people. We shared a belief that youth and emerging &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#adults&quot; title=&quot;People older than you who probably drive you batty. Or, people whose age in years exceeds the legal age of majority; people considered to be adults by law.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;adults&lt;/a&gt; have the power to tap into their collective genius (whenever they want) and they, not adults, are the gurus of their own bodies, minds and hearts. And eventually we discovered that despite our superficial differences (like our age, race, ethnicity or zip codes), Heather and I share similar stories of origin -- we are both the firstborn child to young parents. Throughout the years, we&#039;ve also come to realize that while our stories seem to have run parallel at multiple times, there are points of divergence (like our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender&quot; title=&quot;Characteristics that are seen or presented as distinguishing between male and female in a society. Gender may or may not include assigned or chosen: social roles, feelings, behaviors and/or presentation or appearance.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt; identities, our sexualities, our values or adopted philosophies). Either way, our respective paths have unfolded to complex intersectional identities that we inherited from our diverse, immigrant families and environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&#039;s super important to recognize that we&#039;re all living intersectionally. Whether we name it or not, we each bring some kind of bias, privilege or cultural lens to the conversations and relationships we have -- be it IRL or virtually. So, while &lt;b&gt;Sexuality in Color &lt;/b&gt;is curated by me -- a proud person of color (PoC) -- I won&#039;t ever claim to speak on behalf of ALL PoC. My experience is simply one of many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our histories never unfold in isolation. We cannot truly tell what we consider to be our own histories without knowing the other stories. And often we discover that those other stories are actually our own stories.&lt;/strong&gt; - Angela Davis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more, I&#039;m reminded just how intersectional we all are, even among biological siblings who&#039;ve lived with the same parents in the same house. For instance, what is offensive to me as a Black Latinx, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#cisgender&quot; title=&quot;Describes people who have a gender identity which is traditionally thought to “match” their assigned sex. For instance, someone who was assigned male at birth who identifies as a man. Often used in relation to transgender.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;cisgender&lt;/a&gt; millennial woman may not be so for my younger sister, who identifies the exact same way. Whenever we do have differences of opinions, I don&#039;t find it productive to debate how or why. I&#039;ve come to feel it&#039;s much more helpful if we simply acknowledge and accept that while we&#039;re the same, we&#039;re extremely different &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; it&#039;s perfectly okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here&#039;s the shit I really need to talk about: lately, I&#039;ve been post-traumatically triggered by violent images and language hijacking my social media channels, group chats, radio and television. Most recently, and so sadly, this has come from so many things I&#039;ve seen on #BlackTwitter. The back and forth banter within our tribe has been going from zero to 100, real quick. It&#039;s been everything from: R. Kelly, Michael Jackson, relentless anti-&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#abortion&quot; title=&quot;A procedure to intentionally end a pregnancy before a birth. Miscarriage is also sometimes called &amp;quot;spontaneous abortion,&amp;quot; even though it is usually not intended.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt; trolls, stonings in Brunei and the pervasive misogyny from Silicon Valley to DC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one that really broke my spirit is the tragic murder of Nipsey Hussle. Every time I think about the love and loss his partner, Lauren London, is living through, I experience a profound spiritual heaviness. Maybe it&#039;s because I sincerely appreciated their positive display of Black love and excellence. Maybe it&#039;s because Nip strongly resembles my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#partner&quot; title=&quot;In a sexual context, a person with whom someone is having some kind of sex. The term &amp;quot;partner&amp;quot; can be used for all kinds of relationships, not just serious ones. &amp;quot;Partner&amp;quot; can also mean the person someone is with in a romantic or familial partnership.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;partner&lt;/a&gt;, or because I know deep down inside this hit way too close to home. Gun violence is a pervasive public health issue within our community that cannot be ignored, one of many on the long list of traumas that we as people of color suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I find myself feeling sad, lost or disconnected from my culture, I do a little life hack that I want to share.&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;ve created several curated lists of folks who share my values or who are adding something positive to the culture. When Twitter and Instagram feel like much too much, I immediately go to my short list of inclusionary voices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are six gems I want to shout out for being strong, vibrant voices who consistently show-up and &lt;em&gt;add&lt;/em&gt; value to the collective community. Thank you in advance for being great examples of how to effectively use your influence and position of power to clap back and reclaim our power as PoC. I see you and I appreciate you.&lt;/p&gt;

Fighting with insecurity? Got a hot date? ARE the hot date? Starting a new project, school or job? Going to do something where everyone&#039;s watching? Coming out? Just got tested or asked for what you really, really wanted in bed for the first time? Getting yourself out of a bad &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#relationship&quot; title=&quot;Some kind of ongoing interaction or association with another person, place or thing.

There are all kinds of relationships: family relationships, friendships, romantic relationships, and sexual relationships. Sometimes there is an overlap where we have more than one kind of relationship with someone. Sometimes people use the word relationship to only mean a romantic, &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot;, or committed relationship, even though that&amp;#039;s not all this word means.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;relationship&lt;/a&gt;?  Doing something major, all on your own? Finally really getting that you&#039;re actually seriously fantastic?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to keep it short and sweet this time: this is an extended mix for when you need a little help bigging yourself up, or when you&#039;re already feeling yourself something fierce and you want a soundtrack to truly relish the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Scarleteen Mix #7: Friendship Is Magic</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/scarleteen_mix_7_friendship_is_magic</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;scarleteen mix # 7 - friendship is magic - photo of super cute ponies&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/Scarleteen%20Mixes%20%286%29.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px; height: 300px; margin: 10px; float: right;&quot; /&gt;We&#039;re ponying up and belting it out for our friends this time around!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s a big lovey-dovey holiday coming up tomorrow. Whatever. This year we&#039;re choosing to loudly appreciate and celebrate the love in our friendships, and all the love we&#039;ve got for, and feel from, our friends. Life can be rough, and friendship really &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A few years ago I talked some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/2012/09/04/why_does_friendship_matter_to_a_sex_ed_organization&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; about why I think friendship is a mighty important topic in sex and relationships education: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friendship is at the core of any and every deep, excellent, happy, healthy relationship, whether we&#039;re talking about a friendship that doesn&#039;t have any romance or sex in it at all, or we&#039;re talking about romantic relationships, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual&quot; title=&quot;About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; relationships or both. We think friendship also has an awful lot to do with healthy family relationships, mentorships, and pretty much any ongoing human interaction we could possibly have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our relationships with people will tend to be fluid through our lives. Friends can become lovers, lovers can become friends or family. Our super-sexy-whoo-hoo booty call can wind up being someone we later call co-parent; someone we thought was only eye candy can turn out to be a person we ultimately consider our best friend in the world. Someone we thought was the great big love of our life can wind up a footnote; someone we thought was only a footnote can become the great big love of our life. While for some people, someone they eventually create a family with may be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#romantic&quot; title=&quot;Of, or relating to, intimate or passionate love or interest.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;romantic&lt;/a&gt; or sexual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#partner&quot; title=&quot;In a sexual context, a person with whom someone is having some kind of sex. The term &amp;quot;partner&amp;quot; can be used for all kinds of relationships, not just serious ones. &amp;quot;Partner&amp;quot; can also mean the person someone is with in a romantic or familial partnership.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;partner&lt;/a&gt;, for other folks, that person may be a best friend where those aspects of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#relationship&quot; title=&quot;Some kind of ongoing interaction or association with another person, place or thing.

There are all kinds of relationships: family relationships, friendships, romantic relationships, and sexual relationships. Sometimes there is an overlap where we have more than one kind of relationship with someone. Sometimes people use the word relationship to only mean a romantic, &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot;, or committed relationship, even though that&amp;#039;s not all this word means.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;relationship&lt;/a&gt; don&#039;t come into play or aren&#039;t even wanted by either party. And of course, while for some people, friends with benefits is a bullshit way of getting sex with no intention of ever being a friend, for other people, the &quot;benefits&quot; in an FWB truly do occur within the context of, and as part of, a bonafide friendship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know how vitally important it is for everyone to have a strong support network in their lives. Our friends are who we will tend to go to first when we need some good, outside perspective on our other relationships from someone we know cares about us, someone we know we can trust. Even if and when romantic or sexual relationships are something we want and something we have, those are never the only kind of relationships we all &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt;. Just like when we have a meal, we need more than one kind of nutrition, when it comes to a healthy life, we all need way more than just one kind of relationship. We need our friends, and they need us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: initial;&quot;&gt;Caring for other people isn&#039;t always easy, nor is caring for ourselves in relationships. The first elective -- by choice -- relationships we&#039;ll usually have are with friends, and so friendships are usually the first relationships where we learn about that, about how to treat others with respect and care and be treated that way in mind, where we learn about when to stick it out and when we need to get gone, about boundaries and the lack of them, about things we can do that earnestly help people, and things we can do which really aren&#039;t helping anyone at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: initial;&quot;&gt;Learning how to be friends gives people some of the most important relationship skills any of us can have. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While we hear the phrase &quot;just friends&quot; a lot among our users, we really don&#039;t think there is anything &quot;just&quot; about friendship. We think friendship is a big deal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly. So, whether your friends are your boyfriend, your dog, your best friend from almost the minute you were born, your third cousin, your booty call, your Dad, your guitar teacher, your downstairs neighbor, your brother, your girlfriend, your iguana, your teammates, your band, your Mom, your gaming group, your sister, your cat, your uncle, your cool new friend from work, your lover, your secret crush, your guardian, your gerbil, your stepmom, the kid you mentor, your choir director, your sponsor, your lab partner, your co-author, that cool person you always talk to the whole way home on the bus, your training buddy, the lunch lady, your locker next-door neighbor, or anyone else, this one&#039;s for them.  And for you, friend.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sexuality in Color: Japan&#039;s Terrible Anti-Trans Court Ruling</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/al/sexuality_in_color_japans_terrible_antitrans_court_ruling</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;sexuality in color graphic&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/incolor.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; width: 234px; height: 166px; float: right;&quot; /&gt;On Friday, the Japanese Supreme Court voted to uphold a law that requires &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#transgender&quot; title=&quot;Describes people who find that the gender applied to them because of the sex they were assigned at birth is incorrect.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;transgender&lt;/a&gt; people to be &lt;em&gt;sterilized&lt;/em&gt; before their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender&quot; title=&quot;Characteristics that are seen or presented as distinguishing between male and female in a society. Gender may or may not include assigned or chosen: social roles, feelings, behaviors and/or presentation or appearance.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt; can be legally changed on official documents. Law No. 111, first implemented in 2003, set forth requirements that need to be fulfilled before Japanese trans people could get their gender recognized:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be 20 years old or older;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be presently unmarried;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not presently have any underage children;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gonads&quot; title=&quot;The organs that make ovum or sperm cells (the ovaries and testes respectively).&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gonads&lt;/a&gt; or permanently lack functioning gonads; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a physical form that is “endowed with genitalia that closely resemble the physical form of an alternative gender.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Takakito Usui speaks publicly after hearing that his appeal was denied by the Supreme Court.&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/190125121455-takakito-usui-japan-trans-01-exlarge-169.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: left; width: 500px; height: 281px;&quot; /&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://japantoday.com/category/national/japan-court-upholds-%27sterilisation%27-rule-for-gender-change&quot;&gt;Japan Today&lt;/a&gt;, the Supreme Court judges did express some concerns about these restrictions, but ultimately ruled that Law No. 111 is constitutional, stating that it is intended to &quot;prevent problems in parent-child relations&quot; that could &quot;lead to societal confusion&quot; and &quot;abrupt changes in society&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese and Japanese-American trans people are calling out the falsehoods and injustices of this horrifying and eugenic policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal was originally brought to the Supreme Court by Takakito Usui, a trans man seeking to get his documents changed to reflect his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender_identity&quot; title=&quot;A person&amp;#039;s own sense of whether and in what sense they feel they might be a man, a woman, neither, a mixture of genders, or another gender entirely.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender identity&lt;/a&gt;. This law being upheld means that anyone who doesn&#039;t fit that narrow description and/or doesn&#039;t have the resources to get surgery (not to mention &lt;em&gt;not wanting&lt;/em&gt; to get surgery) will be stuck with documentation that has their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; assigned at birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we&#039;ve discussed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/rebel_well_for_those_who_are_lgbq_andor_trans&quot;&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt;, documents such as identification, birth certificates, and passports are key tools for maintaining stability in the functions of our daily lives. To deny someone access to a way to easily change their documents is to deny them access to healthcare, transportation and travel, financial/government assistance, immigration, marriage and family rights, stable housing, education, and more. If every time a stranger looks at your ID (at a future employer, at the grocery store, when buying a car), they see information that does not match their understanding of you, what kind of harassment, discrimination, and violence might that invoke? And that doesn&#039;t even account for the ways in which trans and gender non-conforming people constantly face discrimination, harassment, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#abuse&quot; title=&quot;Purposeful harm or mistreatment of another person, which can be verbal, emotional, physical or sexual. An ongoing pattern or cycle of such mistreatment or harm can characterize an abusive relationship.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;abuse&lt;/a&gt; even when they &lt;em&gt;do have&lt;/em&gt; documentation that aligns with their lived identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there&#039;s the issue of sterilization. I&#039;ve already &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog/al/sexuality_in_color_the_foundations_of_gynecology&quot;&gt;talked about&lt;/a&gt; the ways in which people of color in the U.S. have been subjected to involuntary sterilization, medical procedures, and invasive treatments for the benefit of scientific and medical institutions. Here, this action is doubled down in that Japanese trans people are not only required to subject themselves to surgery that they might not even want, but are stripped of their right to reproduce. What for? In what way does preventing a trans person from reproducing contribute to their health or quality of life, or those of others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#039;s stance on this outdated and frankly ridiculous law is representative of a failure of the modern justice system to account for changing societal values. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/01/hrw-allegation-letter-un-special-rapporteurs&quot;&gt;report issued  in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, Human Rights watch highlighted just how many international organizations opposed surgical requirements for documentation changes for trans people, and how many governments across the globe (including Germany, India, Nepal, Austria, and Sweden) have taken action to specifically prevent forced sterilization or genital surgery for transgender people. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wpath.org/&quot;&gt;World Professional Association for Transgender Health&lt;/a&gt; (WPATH), made the following comments about these requirements in a 2015 report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No particular medical, surgical, or mental health treatment or diagnosis is an adequate marker for anyone’s gender identity, so these should not be requirements for legal gender change,&quot; and &quot;Marital status and parental status should not affect legal recognition of gender change, and appropriate legal gender recognition should be available to transgender youth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we have yet to win these battles state-by-state in the United States, we here at Scarleteen believe that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#queer&quot; title=&quot;In the context of sexuality, a broad term for sexual orientation that can describe any number of orientations which are not heterosexual. People who identify as queer may be bisexual or pansexual, gay or lesbian, questioning, asexual or more. &quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;queer&lt;/a&gt; and trans people across the globe should have the right to self-identify, the right to love and create whatever families they want, and access the same institutions as anyone else without having to sacrifice their bodily integrity or sense of self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s hoping that Law No. 111 doesn&#039;t stick.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Scarleteen Confidential: Beyond Birds &amp; Bees </title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/sam_w/scarleteen_confidential_beyond_birds_bees%C2%A0</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Scarleteen Confidential: Help for Parents and Families&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/ScarleteenConfidentialsquare.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: right; width: 160px; height: 160px;&quot; /&gt;When the first reviews for &lt;em&gt;Beyond Birds &amp;amp; Bees&lt;/em&gt; started popping up, a common theme within them was that this book should be in the hands of every parent. As someone who writes about the ways parents and other supportive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#adults&quot; title=&quot;People older than you who probably drive you batty. Or, people whose age in years exceeds the legal age of majority; people considered to be adults by law.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;adults&lt;/a&gt; can be a positive force in the lives of young people when it comes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; and sexuality, I agree that the book has a lot to offer in that regard. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bonniejrough.com/beyondbirdsandbees/&quot;&gt;Bonnie Rough&#039;s book &lt;/a&gt;is an accessible, thoughtful examination of the ways in which the culture in the U.S could be radically more positive in its messaging about sex, love, and equality to young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining personal anecdotes from time spent in the Netherlands, research, and interviews, Rough contrasts the approaches to talking with children about sex and sexuality in the Netherlands with approaches common in the U.S. The book addresses how topics like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#anatomy&quot; title=&quot;The body, parts of the body, or physical structure of organisms like people, animals or plants.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;anatomy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#contraception&quot; title=&quot;Devices, medications or behaviors used to intentionally aim to prevent pregnancy, including the condom, the cervical barrier, the implant, the patch, the pill, the rhythm method, the ring, the shot, the IUD, spermicide and withdrawal.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;contraception&lt;/a&gt; are discussed in the home and the classroom in the two counties, and also how subjects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#gender&quot; title=&quot;Characteristics that are seen or presented as distinguishing between male and female in a society. Gender may or may not include assigned or chosen: social roles, feelings, behaviors and/or presentation or appearance.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#consent&quot; title=&quot;To agree to do something or give permission. In the context of sex, a person is giving full consent/is consenting when they freely and actively agree to do something sexual with someone else; however, the person still has the right to change their mind at any point. A person is NOT consenting if they do not actively agree, have been forced or pressured in some way or are in a state where they are incapable of full consent (such as when asleep, under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or below the age of consent).
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;consent&lt;/a&gt;, and pleasure are (or are not) addressed by each culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dutch model is one many sex educators are familiar with. It’s often held up as an example of well-built, comprehensive sex education; a way that sex ed in the U.S &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be if we were somehow able to undo the chokehold abstinence-based programs have on the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dutch curriculum starts in early childhood and continues through the teen years, framing sexuality as simply another part of existing as a person in the world, a part young people deserve information about so that they can make choices that are right for them at different points in their lives. Sex is not treated like a terrifying, taboo thing; but as a part of life with risks and rewards just like any other. In contrast, Rough finds that the U.S approach to sex and sexuality is driven by fear (probably because it is).  A major theme of the book is how parents in the U.S can reflect on and address their fears and, hopefully, transform the ways in which they engage with children and teenagers about sex. As someone who sees daily examples of the way that fear-based approach backfires, it’s nice to see the Dutch model presented as an alternative for parents in a way that outlines the potential benefits of trying a more sex-positive approach to sex ed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One element of the book I really appreciate is that Rough is careful not to frame the Dutch approach as completely without issues, or suggest that the entire country is unified under the banner of providing comprehensive sex ed. There are discussions of how parents can still opt youth out of the programs, and how educators in conservative areas may “sugar-coat” the curriculum by describing it as being about relationships and boundaries, omitting the fact that it is also about sex. Rough is also careful to illustrate the ways in which the Dutch model is incompatible with broader cultural norms of the U.S and how that could make translating the approach from one country to another difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, she outlines the ways in which cultural understandings of “age appropriateness” are radically different in the Netherlands and the U.S, and how that influences sex education in both places. She cites the uproar in the U.S over the book &lt;i&gt;My Mom’s Having a Baby&lt;/i&gt;, and the hand-wringing centered on how having words like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sperm&quot; title=&quot;Reproductive cells of people with penises which can fertilize an ovum and create pregnancy.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sperm&lt;/a&gt; in a book for young children has been seen as inappropriate and as robbing them of innocence. In contrast, she describes a scene from a Dutch classroom in which young children participate in a lively activity that includes, among other things, learning and using the accurate names for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#genitals&quot; title=&quot;External sexual or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;genitals&lt;/a&gt;.  It’s a stark example of how much the American approach to sex ed is governed by a fear that talking about sex, even the most basic way, is somehow corrupting the innocence of children, when in practice it does nothing more than give them information about their own bodies and the bodies of people around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another strength of the book is that Rough is candid in sharing her own struggles with reconciling her own beliefs and feelings with what she learns through her research&lt;b&gt;. &lt;/b&gt; In one chapter, she reflects on the difficulty of discussing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#masturbation&quot; title=&quot;Ways that people seek out and/or experience sexual pleasure by themselves, without a sexual partner.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;masturbation&lt;/a&gt; with young children, and allowing for the acknowledgement of pleasure while still communicating about consent, boundaries, and privacy. She echoes many comprehensive sex educators in her assertion that it is often adult discomfort with the idea of children being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual&quot; title=&quot;About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; beings, or an inability to see things like nudity in a non-sexual light, that drives the way they interact with children’s sexuality. &lt;img alt=&quot;Cover for Beyond Birds and Bees by Bonnie Rough&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/Cover1_BirdsandBees.png&quot; style=&quot;margin: 15px; float: left; width: 200px; height: 300px;&quot; /&gt;She’s honest about the ways in which she, and many other well-meaning parents, can be so focused on how they can prevent negative outcomes of sex that they inadvertently reinforce harmful, sex-negative messages. She poses an alternate question for parents to ponder in place of merely thinking about how to prevent negative outcomes: &lt;em&gt;what are my hopes and dreams for my children in their sexual lives?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an excellent question, one echoed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog/sam_w/2015/08/31/scarleteen_confidential_ten_questions_with_dr_karen_rayne_about_parenting_sex_&quot;&gt;other sex educators&lt;/a&gt;, and one I hope many parents take to heart. But, while it would be wonderful if this book was read by every parent in the country, Rough herself succinctly captures one reason why it won’t be. She notes that there are many times that the benefits of frank, open conversations about sex with children and teens just isn’t enough motivation to cancel out the deep, felt-as-intuitive fear held by many parents that talking about it will make young people more likely to do it (it doesn&#039;t). Some adults will take one look at this book&#039;s premise and refuse to read it. That&#039;s a pity, as Rough is thoughtful and empathetic in addressing the fears parents have about all the ways in which sex ed, either at home or in school, can go wrong and offers excellent ways to navigate those fears while maintaining a sex-positive framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All told, I&#039;ll certainly be adding &lt;i&gt;Beyond Birds &amp;amp; Bees &lt;/i&gt;to my list of recommend reading for parents who want to communicate with children and teens about sex and sexuality in positive ways. It’s an accessible, informative read, and hopefully will encourage adults who read it to try a more open, accepting approach to talking about sex, bodies, gender, and sexuality with young people.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;meta  itemprop=&quot;name&quot; content=&quot;Scarleteen Confidential: Beyond Birds &amp;amp; Bees &quot; id=&quot;md20&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-taxonomy-vocabulary-3 field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/books&quot;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/review&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/parenting&quot;&gt;parenting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/bonnie_rough&quot;&gt;Bonnie Rough&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/beyond_birds_bees&quot;&gt;Beyond Birds &amp;amp; Bees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/dutch_model&quot;&gt;Dutch model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/sex_education&quot;&gt;sex education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/families&quot;&gt;families&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/parents&quot;&gt;parents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/scarleteen_confidential&quot;&gt;scarleteen confidential&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/help&quot;&gt;help&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/resources&quot;&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Scarleteen Mix #6:  Consenting and Other Sexual Communication</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/scarleteen_mix_6_consenting_and_other_sexual_communication</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;scarleteen mix # 6 - consent and other sexual communication - photo of big microphone&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/Scarleteen%20Mixes%20%285%29.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px; height: 300px; margin: 10px; float: right;&quot; /&gt;Real-deal consent requires clear, open and honest communication. And if we&#039;re going ahead and actually being sexual together in some way,  that also means an ongoing, nuanced and pretty highly situational process of communication, not just one or two super-quick, super-basic exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is communication as a process essential to keeping it consensual, it&#039;s a big part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; actually being any &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;for everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve noticed over the years that a lot of people have the idea that consenting and other kinds of sexual communication are like going through a drive-through window to pick up take-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like: &lt;/strong&gt;You roll up and see if the place is open. They are. You decide what you want from the small menu, if you look at it at all, since you usually order the same two things. You shout what you want at some random somebody. If they have the stuff you shouted out, they just give it to you and you give them money.  Maybe they ask one or two extra questions, like if you want fries with that or how you want your change. You answer those (or not), take your stuff, you each say thanks and you roll off as the guy behind you in his giant Dodge Ram starts honking, because of course he does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, if you truly want to do this right, and if you&#039;re actually going ahead and being, and staying, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexually_active&quot; title=&quot;Someone who has had or is currently having some kind of genital sex with a partner or partners.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexually active&lt;/a&gt; with another person, consenting and other sexual communication should be a lot more like going to a long lunch at a nice restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, something more like this:&lt;/strong&gt; You roll up and see if they&#039;re open. They are, so you go in. Someone asks if they can take your coat, and if you want a table. You say you want a table, but you&#039;re keeping your coat with you. They ask if you want this table or that one? You choose that one. They say they’ll be back.  They come offer you water, and ask if you want sparkling or still?  You say still. They pour it. They ask if you want to hear their specials.  You say yes, they tell you. They give you two menus -- one for drinks and one for food -- tell you to take your time, and ask them any questions if you have them. There are a LOT of choices, so you do take some time, thinking about what you&#039;re in the mood for, what looks good, what you know you do and don&#039;t like, the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The come back and your order. You ask them if something on the menu can be adapted in a specific way for you: they say they&#039;re sorry, but it can&#039;t. You say you understand, and go with something else that looked good. You tell them not just what meal you&#039;d like, but how you&#039;d like it -- how you like it cooked, what you want served first if possible, what you want on the side. You order a drink, doing the same. They say they&#039;ll get those things going and you thank them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They bring you your drink. You chill. They come back a little later to ask if your drink is okay and to tell you it&#039;s taking a little longer in the kitchen than anticipated. You say it&#039;s no problem, but thanks. Someone comes and offers you more water. You say yes, please. Your server then brings your meal, asks if it looks okay and if you need anything else. You actually notice your soup has something on it you&#039;re allergic to and tell them. They apologize and say they&#039;ll bring you another, and hope you will enjoy the rest of your meal while they get it. They come back with the soup, ask how your meal is, and you tell them it&#039;s awesome. They say it&#039;s actually their favorite, and you two talk for a little while about how much you both love the meal you&#039;re eating. They ask if you need anything else, and if you&#039;ll want to see a dessert menu.  You say you&#039;re good, and no thanks, you don&#039;t want dessert today.  They bring you the check, they tell you to take as long as you&#039;d like, and you take your time finishing your meal. You pay it, tip your server, you thank each other and you roll on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the differences? How could you miss them? You&#039;ll find them in this mix, too: there&#039;s a whole bunch of back-and-forths and a wide range of not just ways to talk about sex, but different ways we might, whether that&#039;s about telling someone we&#039;re feeling when we&#039;re out with friends to call us the next day when we&#039;re sober, asking someone if they want to touch you, or telling a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#partner&quot; title=&quot;In a sexual context, a person with whom someone is having some kind of sex. The term &amp;quot;partner&amp;quot; can be used for all kinds of relationships, not just serious ones. &amp;quot;Partner&amp;quot; can also mean the person someone is with in a romantic or familial partnership.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;partner&lt;/a&gt; to slow down or &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to touch some part of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I notice is how many people -- especially people who haven&#039;t ever been sexual with others before, or are really new to it all -- still seem to have this super-strange idea that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/abuse_assault/drivers_ed_for_the_sexual_superhighway_navigating_consent&quot;&gt;consenting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/relationships/be_a_blabbermouth_the_whys_whats_and_hows_of_talking_about_sex_with_a_partner&quot;&gt;other sexual communication&lt;/a&gt; in words is a drag, isn&#039;t sexy and somehow ruins the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of different things to say about that. For today, though, I think one of the most important things to know is that talking just at &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; enough to make sure everyone involved is truly on board, really wanting what&#039;s going on, and wanting it HOW it&#039;s going on, for every part of what you do, is vital, no matter what. That&#039;s because what &lt;strong&gt;actually&lt;/strong&gt; ruins the moment are sexual abuse, assault and being or feeling unable to stop someone from doing something sexual to you that you don&#039;t want, really doesn&#039;t feel good or is freaking you out or otherwise has you feeling very not okay in some way. Sexual abuse, assault and otherwise being or feeling unable to stop something sexual being done to you you don&#039;t want, don&#039;t like or simply feels bad for you do very serious harm and usually create very difficult and long-lasting emotional, physical, interpersonal and even economic consequences for those victimized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#039;re going to worry about the impact of your sexual communication choices, I really hope you worry most about preventing serious sexual harm and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#trauma&quot; title=&quot;A serious or critical physical and/or emotional injury or physically and/or emotionally painful experience.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;trauma&lt;/a&gt; -- and participate in sexual communication and sexual choices that make make that harm prevention your top priority -- not the momentary, no-big-deal loss of your own or someone else&#039;s buzz or boner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think this is the second most important thing to know:&lt;/strong&gt; it DOESN&#039;T ruin the moment when the moment is everyone involved actually wanting to totally be there and to really be as close with each other as sex can put us. It is NOT a drag and is NOT unsexy to say and hear what&#039;s wanted and liked (and what isn&#039;t, too!), and how everyone involved is really feeling. Instead, what sexual communication can do in that context is not only prevent sexual trauma, but help everyone involved have more emotionally healthy, fulfilling and satisfying sexual interactions and sexual lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maybe that&#039;s why so many of the songs in this mix  -- created and curated by me with some sweet additions from Sam, Jacob, Siân, Alice M. and Al , that you can listen to on &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/playlist/scarleteen-mix-6-consent/pl.u-LeL3umzq6X&quot;&gt;Apple Music&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6uTVDBbOFqEj650KagzvIU?si=9t2hEKf8SXCuPWICXbHXgg&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; -- sound so very good. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Scarleteens, All Growed Up</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/alice_m/scarleteens_all_growed_up</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s Scarleteen’s 20th birthday. I feel like Scarleteen is ALL GROWED UP. Millions of people who have used Scarleteen over the last two decades, or have been part of it as volunteers or other staff, are now, too. Some of us who were part of Scarleteen as teenagers are even now the parents of teenagers or soon-to-be&#039;s &lt;em&gt;ourselves&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This got us thinking:&lt;/strong&gt; with 20 years of user, volunteer and staff involvement, how did &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;grow up with and through Scarleteen? We&#039;ve got some answers to that question from a few other Scarleteen alums below, but first, I want to share a piece of my own growing up story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel grown up in a lot of ways &lt;em&gt;because &lt;/em&gt;of Scarleteen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was 18 years old, pregnant and scared. When I was somewhat housebound due to shame, Scarleteen was there for me with support and encouragement throughout my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#pregnancy&quot; title=&quot;The state of carrying a developing embryo or fetus within the uterus. Medically, someone is considered to be pregnant when an egg has been fertilized by sperm, cells divide, and the fertilized egg is implanted within the lining of the uterus.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; and early years of parenting. They treated me with more respect and dignity than most of my family, friends, school staff, medical personnel or strangers did. They were realistic, accurate and kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#partner&quot; title=&quot;In a sexual context, a person with whom someone is having some kind of sex. The term &amp;quot;partner&amp;quot; can be used for all kinds of relationships, not just serious ones. &amp;quot;Partner&amp;quot; can also mean the person someone is with in a romantic or familial partnership.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;partner&lt;/a&gt; was abusive and my child was very young, I was terrified and isolated. Scarleteen taught me about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#abuse&quot; title=&quot;Purposeful harm or mistreatment of another person, which can be verbal, emotional, physical or sexual. An ongoing pattern or cycle of such mistreatment or harm can characterize an abusive relationship.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;abuse&lt;/a&gt;, what healthy relationships could look like and provided resources. They didn’t give up on me when I didn’t leave right away. They planted seeds. They celebrated with me when I left and created safety for my little family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Scarleteen’s love, support and education, I grew up. My process led me from being a Scarleteen user to becoming a Scarleteen volunteer. I had the new-found ability to help others, as well as contribute to this community that I loved so dearly. Through Scarleteen, I found my niche as an educator working with youth; I found my confidence. I stretched my wings with an opportunity provided by Scarleteen to do outreach with homeless youth. My history of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#trauma&quot; title=&quot;A serious or critical physical and/or emotional injury or physically and/or emotionally painful experience.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;trauma&lt;/a&gt; became a strength that I used to empower and help others and, as I discovered, it became a strength that I used to empower myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All my experiences with Scarleteen not only helped me grow, it also provided ample resume experience and references that I then used to secure other types of employment on my path to growing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m 31 years old now. After an extended absence, I’m volunteering with Scarleteen again and it feels like home. I will always be immensely grateful for the gifts you&#039;ve given me. You helped shape me into the confident parent, educator, partner, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#queer&quot; title=&quot;In the context of sexuality, a broad term for sexual orientation that can describe any number of orientations which are not heterosexual. People who identify as queer may be bisexual or pansexual, gay or lesbian, questioning, asexual or more. &quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;queer&lt;/a&gt;, disabled, grown-up human that I am today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Birthday Scarleteen! I love you.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Happy 20th F#$@&amp;%* Birthday, Scarleteen!</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/happy_20th_f_birthday_scarleteen</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/qse.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px; height: 253px; float: right;&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scarleteen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; turns 20 years old today. &lt;b&gt;Twenty.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For two decades, we’ve delivered our unique and innovative brand of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; education, despite many financial, legal, political and practical barriers and battles. That kind of tenure for anything on the internet is unheard of, let alone for a grassroots, feminist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual&quot; title=&quot;About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; health, sex and healthy relationships initiative and alternative education project for young people, and one that was (and still is) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#queer&quot; title=&quot;In the context of sexuality, a broad term for sexual orientation that can describe any number of orientations which are not heterosexual. People who identify as queer may be bisexual or pansexual, gay or lesbian, questioning, asexual or more. &quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;queer&lt;/a&gt;, working class and woman-led.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Centering and serving young people, sexuality and relationships like we do, with inspired quality, care and vision, and doing so independently — and &lt;b&gt;for free&lt;/b&gt; — for so long is so rare. Very few organizations and resources have consistently delivered all of what we do, as well as we do, and to as many as we have, for this long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been the most demanding work of my life, but also the greatest privilege.  This sure isn&#039;t what I&#039;d planned to do with my life twenty years ago. Whoooooo boy, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog/sam_w/scarleteen_timeline&quot;&gt;has it been a&lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;ride&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but I&#039;m so grateful and glad for the incredible challenge, the adventure and the profound education that Scarleteen has afforded me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked very hard to get us here, but I haven’t done it alone. Without help and participation from volunteers, staff and outside helpers and supporters, we wouldn’t still be here. Without our users, we never would have been here in the first place. We certainly wouldn’t have had the direction and inspiration they’ve given us, nor the chance to have been taught so much by our learners, something I have always believed is essential for any great educator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We couldn’t have done it without help from independent donors, who&#039;ve been our sole source of financial support most of the time we’ve been running. You&#039;ve not only helped fund Scarleteen and all it does, you&#039;ve allowed us to maintain our independence so we could provide truly learner-centered sex education and do it the &lt;i&gt;way&lt;/i&gt; we do. Our donors have also literally kept a roof over my head and put food on my table for many years, something that means the world to me, especially as my ability to work jobs outside Scarleteen to support it and myself changed, and during times I was trying to keep Scarleteen afloat while managing major illness, disability and other big challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for what you’ve given, in whatever unique way you have, to help Scarleteen reach this massive milestone. Thank you for your faith in us, in me, in young people and in the power of quality sex and relationships education. Thank you for helping us to grow and sustain a unique organization and resource I feel confident has the ability to continue to lead in our field and be what young people want and need it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/InSexEdWeTrust_forweb.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px; height: 300px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about what Scarleteen and myself can do through this anniversary year to celebrate all we’ve been and have become, and to best set us up for another 20 years to come. I’ll be sharing those thoughts, plans and our new developments with you as we get there, both on the site and in our social media all through the next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today, I’d like to ask &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; to consider what you can do right now to help celebrate and sustain us, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are five things you may be able to do right now that can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Make an end of the year donation&lt;/strong&gt; to help us start 2019 on solid financial ground. We are still primarily supported by independent donors like yourself, and we still operate on a very small budget for such a very big service. &lt;strong&gt;You can donate online using a debit/credit card or PayPal through Network for Good &lt;a href=&quot;https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/1433116?code=STPRIMARY&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Recurring donations -- even for as little as $10 a month -- are particularly helpful, if you&#039;re able.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Buy Scarleteen swag! &lt;/strong&gt;We’ve got a Threadless shop with some pretty cool stuff, including our new anniversary art and our popular Queer Sex Ed for All logo &lt;a href=&quot;https://scarleteen.threadless.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Buy copies of &lt;i&gt;S.E.X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.: You can find out more about my popular and pioneering sexuality, sexual health and relationships guide, now in its second edition, and some of the places you can buy it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/read/all_about_s_e_x_the_scarleteen_book&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also really helpful to add reviews to online vendors if you&#039;ve already got it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Share a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/scarleteen_testimonials&quot;&gt;testimonial&lt;/a&gt; about Scarleteen&lt;/strong&gt; with your own network -- in your social media, through email, or even just at a work lunch. Tell them why you value and support our work and how they can help support it, too. It’s helpful to recirculate things we say and post, but it’s even more effective to speak from your own heart, head and experience: that usually resonates much more deeply with people who know you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d say I can’t believe we’re at 20 years, because it’s been so hard to keep this going sometimes. I remember thinking we couldn’t possibly make to the next year many times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;But I &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; believe it, because I have &lt;b&gt;always&lt;/b&gt; believed in Scarleteen, what it has done in the past, still does now and what it can do in the future.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can believe it because I know how many people out there, maybe including you, have always believed in us -- and supported us -- too. I just can’t possibly thank everyone enough for that, but you can rest assured that over the next year, I’m sure going to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes these birthdays bring folks out of the woodwork who hadn&#039;t checked us out in a while to even know we&#039;re still around!  If that sounds like you, why not give us a follow on our social media channels: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/scarleteen?lang=en&quot;&gt;@Scarleteen&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/scarleteenorg/&quot;&gt;@Scarleteenorg&lt;/a&gt; on Instagram, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Scarleteen/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook and &lt;a href=&quot;http://hellyeahscarleteen.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;hellyeahscarleteen&lt;/a&gt; on Tumblr? That way you can keep up with all of the awesome we keep on doing. :)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Let&#039;s Get This Anniversary Party STARTED!</title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/lets_get_this_anniversary_party_started</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Scarleteen 20th Anniversary graphic: In Sex Ed We Trust: 1998 - 2018: Inclusive, Comprehensive, Supportive, Innovative&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/InSexEdWeTrust_forweb%20%281%29.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin: 10px; float: right; width: 300px; height: 300px;&quot; /&gt;What&#039;s that shiny graphic there? Why, that&#039;s just a lovely little commemorative doodle we asked artist-in-residence Isabella Rotman to do for our&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;TWENTIETH FREAKING ANNIVERSARY.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For real, we turn 20 on Saturday. &lt;strong&gt;TWENTY.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#queer&quot; title=&quot;In the context of sexuality, a broad term for sexual orientation that can describe any number of orientations which are not heterosexual. People who identify as queer may be bisexual or pansexual, gay or lesbian, questioning, asexual or more. &quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;queer&lt;/a&gt;, scrappy, irreverent little &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; education engine that (sometimes barely, but still) could...well, somehow actually &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;did&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m not going to get ahead of myself here, though. It&#039;s not even Saturday yet, and once it is, I&#039;ve got a lot of time and space to talk about reaching twenty as an organization, a resource and, at this point, an institution (you can argue we aren&#039;t one, but then it&#039;ll be very obvious you&#039;ve never worked here). I&#039;m not going to even &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; to talk about everything that&#039;s part of this milestone all by myself in just one sitting. Even as someone who can way too many words into just about anything, I just don&#039;t think I possibly could!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, a bunch of us are going to have plenty to say about this over the whole next year. It took an awful lot to get this far, and we&#039;ll be in no hurry to stop reflecting or celebrating any time soon. I&#039;m really excited about some of the content we&#039;ll have to share with you from now through 2019 for and about our 20th, as well as some new projects and developments coming up within the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In historically Scarleteen form, we don&#039;t see any reason to wait on getting this party started, so we&#039;re not gonna. Today we&#039;re rolling out our latest mix, a soundtrack for the lovers, the dreamers, and, most of all, the original sex educators, homespun emotional supporters, and other renegade, rebel helpers of the past, present and future. Listen up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3aC1KZgvy5V6ykKOaGqBfl?si=IgkX9nz0Siqg75dZ-Dy92Q&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spotify&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/playlist/scarleteen-mix-6-20-years-of-scarleteen/pl.u-bVletzVN3A&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Music&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;! It&#039;s been a serious trip and one helluva journey around here, and it sounds just a little bit like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oh, hey, wait!&lt;/strong&gt; One more thing! Love our anniversary graphic (we sure do!)? Then check out &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scarleteen.threadless.com/&quot;&gt;our Threadless shop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with all our designs, now &lt;a href=&quot;https://scarleteen.threadless.com/designs/in-sex-ed-we-trust&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;including this one&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;! That&#039;s an easy way to get some sweet sex ed swag that also tosses a few bucks in the process to this organization that happens to give some sweet sex ed. You can even get free shipping through the end of the day today if you run over there right now with the code: FREESHIP117d1b5e&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you&#039;ll stay tuned over the next week for all we&#039;re rolling out as we start our 20th anniversary year! Keep your eyes on the site and on our social media channels: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/scarleteen?lang=en&quot;&gt;@Scarleteen&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/scarleteenorg/&quot;&gt;@Scarleteenorg&lt;/a&gt; on Instagram, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Scarleteen/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook and &lt;a href=&quot;http://hellyeahscarleteen.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;hellyeahscarleteen&lt;/a&gt; on Tumblr. There&#039;ll be a handful of different ways you can take part in some of the shenanigans we&#039;ve got planned, and I really hope you will. This, like everything else we&#039;ve done over the last 20 years, just wouldn&#039;t be the same without all of you.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Scarleteen Timeline </title>
 <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/blog/sam_w/scarleteen_timeline</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of my projects over the last year has been a full content review of Scarleteen. I have now literally read every blog, every article, every advice column we have ever published. Besides our director and founder Heather Corinna, I don&#039;t think anyone else on earth has read as much of Scarleteen as I have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;4 Scarleteen Logos&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/4logos.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 200px; height: 232px; float: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;&quot; /&gt;Doing that gave me a chance to absorb how much Scarleteen has done in twenty years, and how many big events we’ve been around for. Scarleteen has been around long enough to both see the landscape of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sexual&quot; title=&quot;About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sexual&lt;/a&gt; health, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#queer&quot; title=&quot;In the context of sexuality, a broad term for sexual orientation that can describe any number of orientations which are not heterosexual. People who identify as queer may be bisexual or pansexual, gay or lesbian, questioning, asexual or more. &quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;queer&lt;/a&gt; rights and, heck, even the internet, change dramatically. Scarleteen played a part in many of those changes; sometimes a big one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pink Slip Menu Graphic&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/pinkslip.png&quot; style=&quot;float: right; width: 148px; height: 505px;&quot; /&gt;To mark our twentieth, I want to share a timeline I think shows some of what we’ve accomplished over the years, with some major political and social events thrown in for perspective (those events are U.S-focused, because our base of operations is in the U.S and therefore is most affected by things that happen there). Included in the timeline are the debuts of some of the articles that have become classics, that we still use in our work with users, and that are still read by some of the tens of thousands of young people who come to Scarleteen to read up here each and every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1998:&lt;/strong&gt; Heather starts getting emails from young people asking questions about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; through Scarlet Letters, a website about sexuality for adult women (that was pioneering in and of itself!) they&#039;d also founded and ran at the time. Heather realizes there&#039;s nowhere online teens can safely ask questions about sex or get reliable, supportive and sex-positive answers&lt;em&gt; and&lt;/em&gt; that they need a redirect for under-18s on Scarlet Letters, anyway. So, they answer the emails. Some of these questions and answers are originally posted as extra pages on Scarlet Letters in a sub-site first called &quot;Pink Slip.&quot; A reader writes in soon enough and suggests these questions and answers need their own place: they say Scarlet Letters needs a &quot;Scarlet Teen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest, as they say, is (a long) history of people not understanding what on earth our name means. And thus a brand-new kind of sex education, with many brand-new ways of doing it, at a place (the internet) that was still pretty brand-new itself, was born. (Heather also apparently then thought of this as their &quot;little side project,&quot; and has felt quite foolish about how totally delusional that was ever since.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the year that the&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Online_Protection_Act&quot;&gt; Child Online Protection Act (COPA)&lt;/a&gt; is introduced in response to large portions of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Decency_Act&quot;&gt;Communications Decency Act&lt;/a&gt; being struck down. Both acts were designed to limit minors&#039; access to pornographic or &quot;harmful&quot; material on the internet, but in practice would have also prevented youth from accessing crucial educational resources such as Scarleteen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1999:&lt;/strong&gt; We get our URL and unleash our first site design! Some of the first articles published include: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/bodies/innies_outies_the_vagina_clitoris_uterus_and_more&quot;&gt;“Innies &amp;amp; Outies: The Vagina, Uterus, Clitoris and More”&lt;/a&gt;, “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/gender/is_masturbation_okay_yep&quot;&gt;Is Masturbation Okay (yep)?&lt;/a&gt;” and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/abuse_assault/dealing_with_rape&quot;&gt;“Dealing with Rape.”&lt;/a&gt; In the wider world, Plan B is approved by the FDA. Heather moves Scarleteen to Minneapolis (a choice influenced in part by stalking that occurs because of their work with Scarlet Letters and Scarleteen), and Scarleteen gets its first major media coverage in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/scarleteen_in_the_media_the_city_pages&quot;&gt;The City Pages&lt;/a&gt;. Heather and Hanne Blank start to map out the first book proposal for what will much later become &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/read/all_about_s_e_x_the_scarleteen_book&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;S.E.X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/vote2.gif&quot; style=&quot;margin: 5px 10px; float: left; width: 152px; height: 320px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;000:&lt;/strong&gt; We publish our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/relationships/ready_or_not_the_scarleteen_sex_readiness_checklist&quot;&gt;Sex Readiness Checklist&lt;/a&gt;, along with other classic pieces, like the first version of “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/bodies/where_did_i_come_from_a_refresher_course_in_human_reproduction&quot;&gt;Human Reproduction: A Seafarers Guide&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/sexuality/sexual_response_orgasm_a_users_guide&quot;&gt;Sexual Response &amp;amp; Orgasm: A Users Guide&lt;/a&gt;.” We also launch our message boards and bring on our first wave of volunteers to help staff them. George W. Bush, whose administration will go on to allocate 117 million dollars for abstinence-only education, is elected president. We will fight against abstinence-only and work with users struggling because of its negative impacts and outcomes ever after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2001:&lt;/strong&gt; We publish “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/bodies/on_the_rag_a_guide_to_menstruation&quot;&gt;On the Rag: A Guide to Menstruation&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/bodies/innies_outies_the_penis_testes_and_more&quot;&gt;Innies and Outies: The Penis, Testes, &amp;amp; More&lt;/a&gt;.” We had been part of the (now sadly defunct) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iowastatedaily.com/article_9a1a49df-0b02-509f-ba75-bca5f8c9c4bb.html&quot;&gt;ChickClick Network&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed us about nine months of not-totally-terrible funding for about nine months and then the financial bottom completely falls out of the internet and ChickClick closes. Welp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/sites/files/scarleteen/chick.png&quot; style=&quot;float: right; width: 130px; height: 130px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2002:&lt;/strong&gt; We do another redesign, and start including things like news and a listing of the top ten articles on the front page of our site. Those top ten articles at the time are about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#anatomy&quot; title=&quot;The body, parts of the body, or physical structure of organisms like people, animals or plants.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;anatomy&lt;/a&gt;, porn, orgasm, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#safer_sex&quot; title=&quot;Practices which aim to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections, such as use of condoms and other latex/nonlatex barriers, regular testing for infections and limiting the number of sexual partners. It&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;safer&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot; because these practices can reduce risks greatly, but cannot remove all risk.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;safer sex&lt;/a&gt;. At this point we are serving around 2 million users each year. Heather starts writing the book that will become &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/read/all_about_s_e_x_the_scarleteen_book&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;S.E.X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2003:&lt;/strong&gt; We publish “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/bodies/10_of_the_best_things_you_can_do_for_your_sexual_self_at_any_age&quot;&gt;The 10 Best Things You Can Do for Your Sexual Self (At Any Age)&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/bodies/mia_or_dude_wheres_my_period&quot;&gt;M.I.A (Or Dude, Where’s My Period&lt;/a&gt;).” The Supreme Court produces a victory for sexual freedom and queer rights by overturning all &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sodomy&quot; title=&quot;A vague term which either means any kind of genital sex other than vaginal intercourse, or any kind of sex a given group or person considers &amp;quot;unnatural&amp;quot; or sinful.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;sodomy&lt;/a&gt; laws in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2004:&lt;/strong&gt; A good year for medications relating to sexual health, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#emergency_contraception&quot; title=&quot;A method of contraception used to prevent pregnancy after sex or rape has already occurred, rather than used before or during, like most types of contraception.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;emergency contraception&lt;/a&gt; becomes a more prominent topic on the site and Truvada is first approved by the FDA. With Scarleteen getting more and more visible, Heather frequently has to work through more character attacks and harassment -- especially as a queer woman, as a person with sexual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#trauma&quot; title=&quot;A serious or critical physical and/or emotional injury or physically and/or emotionally painful experience.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;trauma&lt;/a&gt;, someone who did adult sex and sexuality work, and just as a person with an unhidden sexuality, period, all things that were all largely not considered acceptable for people providing sex education to young people at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2005: &lt;/strong&gt;We devote a large portion of our front page to promoting our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/bb/index.php&quot; style=&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;message boards&lt;/a&gt; and directing users to information that can help lower chlamydia rates in young women. Our blog is very dedicated to reporting on the legal battle over accessing Plan B over-the-counter and offering our users ways to advocate for that access. In the United States, Representative Barbara Lee and Senator Frank Lautenberg introduced &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feminist.org/news/newsbyte/uswirestory.asp?id=8896&quot; style=&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;a bill &lt;/a&gt;that would provide $206 million a year to states for comprehensive, medically accurate, and science-based &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#sex&quot; style=&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot; title=&quot;Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs.&quot;&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2006: &lt;/strong&gt;We continue to track the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/2006/09/06/the_morning_after_the_morning_after_or_what_the_fda_decision_about_p&quot;&gt;legal status of Plan B&lt;/a&gt;, and offer users updated information on how they can access emergency contraception. This is also the year that the Gardasil vaccine for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#HPV&quot; title=&quot;Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a very common sexually transmitted infection with more than 40 HPV types that can infect the genitals as well as the mouth and throat. Some types of HPV can cause cancers, and some types cause genital warts. There are vaccines for some types of HPV, and those with HPV require medical treatment.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;HPV&lt;/a&gt; is first approved for use, and we create content to address &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/gender/the_hpv_vaccine_faq&quot;&gt;myths and facts&lt;/a&gt; about the vaccine. Scarleteen goes to Washington (state, with Heather, who moves there).&lt;/p&gt;

The first edition of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/read/all_about_s_e_x_the_scarleteen_book&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;S.E.X: The all-you-need-to-know sexuality guide to get you through your teens and twenties&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is published and we redesign and then migrate the site to Drupal (which means Heather no longer has to code the site by hand, a thing they were doing up until now). We also publish “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/bodies/positively_informed_an_hivaids_roundup&quot;&gt;Positively Informed: An HIV/AIDS Round-Up&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/etc/what_is_feminist_sex_education&quot;&gt;What is Feminist Sex Education?&lt;/a&gt;&quot; and “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/read/reciprocity_reloaded&quot;&gt;Reciprocity, Reloaded&lt;/a&gt;.” We start winning some awards, starting with The Champions of Sexual Literacy Award for Grassroots Activism from the National Sexuality Resource Center/SFSU. Heather talks &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/2007/02/14/shameless&quot;&gt;Shamelessness&lt;/a&gt; in a fundraising effort for Scarleteen, and does some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/2007/10/23/one_ring_to_rule_them_all&quot;&gt;pushback against the rising tide of purity culture&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/2007/07/28/dear_new_york_times&quot;&gt;abstinence-only education&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Barack Obama becomes president, we &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/2008/01/02/happy_new_year_and_a_happy_10th_year_to_scarleteen&quot;&gt;turn ten years old&lt;/a&gt;, publish our giant &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/sexual_health/birth_control_bingo&quot;&gt;Birth Control Bingo&lt;/a&gt; piece, and are a major player (after years of leadup work behind the scenes) in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/2008/07/22/copa_kicked_soundly_to_the_curb&quot;&gt;COPA court case&lt;/a&gt;, helping to net a win that allows young people to retain access on the internet to things sex education and other content. To top it all off, the FDA approves a new version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#female_condom&quot; title=&quot;A barrier method of contraception somewhat similar to a male condom, but inserted into the vagina rather than put on the penis. It has a flared base that sits on the outer parts of the vulva to hold it in place. Also known as an internal condom.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;female condom&lt;/a&gt;. Heather gives a talk about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/2008/05/06/what_would_maria_do_one_sex_educators_everevolving_manifesto&quot;&gt;doing sex education as a Montessori educator&lt;/a&gt; but also deals with some&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/2008/04/07/the_revolution_will_be_televised_and_ill_find_a_way_to_be_okay_with_&quot;&gt; tough responses after a lot of media exposure as a sexual assault survivor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2009:&lt;/strong&gt; We introduce our texting service, and Heather’s advice columns are syndicated at Rewire. We bring real talk about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#hymen&quot; title=&quot;A thin membrane without nerve endings that most people with vaginas are born with that is just inside the vaginal opening. It gradually wears away over time due to hormones, vaginal discharges, general physical activity, sex and masturbation and/or childbirth. It does not snap, crackle or pop.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;hymen&lt;/a&gt; to the internet and beyond  -- and information that wasn&#039;t widely known then! -- by pairing up with the RSFU to release &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/bodies/my_corona_the_anatomy_formerly_known_as_the_hymen_the_myths_that_surround_it&quot;&gt;My Corona: The Hymen &amp;amp; the Myths That Surround It&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/2009/06/04/what_weve_lost_why_we_stay&quot;&gt;Abortion provider and reproductive justice hero George Tiller is mur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/2009/06/04/what_weve_lost_why_we_stay&quot;&gt;dered&lt;/a&gt;.  Heather gives a talk about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/2009/03/01/on_innovation_and_inclusivity_in_sex_education&quot;&gt;innovation and inclusivity in sex ed&lt;/a&gt;, wins the Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality, Western Region&#039;s Public Service Award and the Our Bodies, Ourselves&#039; Women&#039;s Health Heroes Award for their work with Scarleteen. &lt;em&gt;Yes Means Yes&lt;/em&gt; (and Heather&#039;s seminal piece, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/gender/an_immodest_proposal&quot;&gt;An Immodest Proposal&lt;/a&gt;, within it) is published.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/sites/files/scarleteen/styles/large/public/images/YesMeansYes.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin: 5px; float: right; width: 150px; height: 225px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2010:&lt;/strong&gt; We do another site redesign and publish two pieces that become instant classics: “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/advice/yes_no_maybe_so_a_sexual_inventory_stocklist&quot;&gt;Yes, No, Maybe So: A Sexual Inventory Stocklist&lt;/a&gt;” and &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/abuse_assault/drivers_ed_for_the_sexual_superhighway_navigating_consent&quot;&gt;Drivers Ed for the Sexual Super Highway: Navigating Consent&lt;/a&gt;.” We also offer peer education training for budding sex educators, and begin to incorporate more and more content into the site for those who are in or who have survived &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/2010/05/29/to_current_resident_of_that_brokendown_house&quot;&gt;abuse&lt;/a&gt;. We do a tweetstorm about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/2010/05/12/how_can_sex_ed_prevent_rape&quot;&gt;How Sex Ed Can Prevent Rape&lt;/a&gt;, and Heather&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/2010/08/04/pump_up_the_voleume_talking_oxytocin&quot;&gt;piece debunking conservative claims about oxytocin&lt;/a&gt; goes viral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2011:&lt;/strong&gt; We introduce our (now retired) Find-a-Doc sexual healthcare database and publish “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/bodies/sexuality_wtf_is_it_anyway&quot;&gt;Sexuality, WTF is it Anyway&lt;/a&gt;?” On the blog, Heather writes about the&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/2011/07/25/because_yes_it_really_does_happen_a_thank_you_to_slutwalks&quot;&gt; rise and politics of SlutWalks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;birth control&lt;/a&gt; methods such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#IUD&quot; title=&quot;Intra-uterine device. A long-term birth control method inserted into the uterus by a healthcare provider. Also called an IUS or IUC.&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;IUD&lt;/a&gt; are not only safe, but even a better choice for young people than more commonly recommended methods like the birth control pill. Heather is given the Joan Helmich Educator of the Year award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2013: &lt;/strong&gt;We introduce our live chat service and publish “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/abuse_assault/selfcare_a_la_carte&quot;&gt;Self-Care: A La Carte&lt;/a&gt;.” On the blog, Heather implores people to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/2013/02/01/please_stop_calling_rape_sex&quot;&gt;Please Stop Calling Rape Sex&lt;/a&gt;&quot; and explains &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/2013/02/18/after_contraception_or_commitment_why_you_still_gotta_rock_safer_sex&quot;&gt;After Contraception or Commitment, Why Your Still Gotta Rock Safer Sex&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; Heather wins the Woodhull Foundation&#039;s Vicki Award.&lt;/p&gt;

Making Choices about Casual Sex&lt;/a&gt;” is published, as is our first article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/sexuality/diy_sex_toys_selflove_edition&quot;&gt;D.I.Y sex toys&lt;/a&gt;. The latter becomes one of the most viewed articles on the site. I didn&#039;t mention the gazillion times over all these years we almost shut down, or that Heather was working one or two additonal jobs to try and pay for Scarleteen on top of themselves, or all the different times we begged folks for financial help to keep us going, each time somehow working it out to barely scrape by. But in 2014, we only got a few hundred dollars in response to our ask for funding &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;for the whole freaking year&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and found ourselves with no other choice but to prepare to engage in a labor strike. People showed up for us in droves in response, and that kept our doors open. It still remains a struggle since, but that year was the start of a more stable pattern for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Trans Summer School&quot; src=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/sites/files/scarleteen/styles/article_image/public/article_images/TransSummerSchoolBox.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 150px; height: 150px; float: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;&quot; /&gt;2015:&lt;/strong&gt; I join as staff (I started as a volunteer in 2013)! We launch several new features including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/about_scarleteen_confidential&quot;&gt;Scarleteen Confidential&lt;/a&gt;, a resource for parents and other supportive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scarleteen.com/glossary#adults&quot; title=&quot;People older than you who probably drive you batty. Or, people whose age in years exceeds the legal age of majority; people considered to be adults by law.
&quot; class=&quot;lexicon-term&quot;&gt;adults&lt;/a&gt;, and our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/condom_shop&quot;&gt;One-Stop Safer Sex Shop&lt;/a&gt; that gives users another way to access safer sex supplies. Continuing the safer sex supplies theme, this is the year we publish “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/bodies/all_the_barriers_all_the_time&quot;&gt;All the Barriers! All the Time&lt;/a&gt;!” And we celebrate with the rest of the queer community as same-gender marriage is legalized in the United States. Heather receives the Steinem-Waters Award and the Golden Brick Award.&lt;/p&gt;

The second edition of &lt;em&gt;S.E.X&lt;/em&gt; is released, we publish our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/gender/welcome_to_trans_summer_school&quot;&gt;Trans Summer School Series&lt;/a&gt;, Heather writes about &quot;The Myth of the&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog_entry/the_myth_of_the_buttheresnoway_abuser&quot;&gt; But-There&#039;s-No-Way Abuser,&lt;/a&gt;&quot; and we redesign the site to create the current iteration. But we also publish “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/politics_etc/rebel_well_a_starter_survival_guide_to_a_trumped_america&quot;&gt;Rebel Well: A Starter Survival  Guide to a Trumped America&lt;/a&gt;”, a response to the results of the 2016 presidential election. We mourn the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog/sam_w/scarleteen_confidential_in_the_wake_of_a_tragedy&quot;&gt;Pulse Massacre&lt;/a&gt; while staffing all our direct services non-stop in order to support young people in the wake of the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017: &lt;/strong&gt;We publish our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/sexuality/disabled_sex_yes&quot;&gt;Sex and Disability series&lt;/a&gt;, re-start our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog/al/sexuality_in_color_rebooted&quot;&gt;Sexuality in Color series&lt;/a&gt;, and release “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/bodies/the_pregnancy_panic_companion&quot;&gt;The Pregnancy Panic Companion”&lt;/a&gt; to act as a virtual doula for users experiencing pregnancy scares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2018:&lt;/strong&gt; The content on our site continues to reflect the needs of our users, just as it did twenty years ago. We introduce more information on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/relationships_sexual_identity_in_your_own_words/just_the_basics_ace_an_asexuality_primer&quot;&gt;sexual orientation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/bodies_politics_sexual_identity_sexuality_gender/lets_talk_about_girldick&quot;&gt;gender identity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/sexual_health/the_real_deal_on_hiv_prep_and_pep&quot;&gt;PrEP and PEP&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/qa/welcome_to_impurity_culture_emily_joy_and_hannah_boning_on_sex_and_relationships&quot;&gt;I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/qa/welcome_to_impurity_culture_emily_joy_and_hannah_boning_on_sex_and_relationships&quot;&gt;mpurity Culture series&lt;/a&gt;. We throw in lighter content, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/blog/heather_corinna/we_love_you_so_much_we_made_you_a_mixtape&quot;&gt;our mixtapes&lt;/a&gt;, because we know our users need a break from the heavy stuff going on in the world. Scarleteen (and Heather) starts a move back to Chicago where it all began. And we continue to write about ways our users can be aware of and fight for their rights, whether that means &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/politics/so_brett_got_confirmed_now_what&quot;&gt;protecting abortion access&lt;/a&gt; and voting to help &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scarleteen.com/article/politics/power_at_the_polls_why_voting_matters&quot;&gt;build a better future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
