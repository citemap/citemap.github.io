<p>Heather is an activist, writer, artist, teacher and community organizer. Heather has been widely recognized as a pioneer of both women's and young adult sexuality information and education online, having brought inclusive, feminist, creative and comprehensive sexuality content to the web and beyond since 1997. Heather is the author of the inclusive, comprehensive and progressive <a href="glossary.html#sex" title="Different things people choose to do to actively express or enact sexuality and sexual feelings; often this involves genitals, but not always. The word sex also means a way people, animals or plants are classified based on their chromosomes, genitals or reproductive organs." class="lexicon-term">sex</a>, <a href="glossary.html#sexual" title="About or relating in some way to sex or sexuality." class="lexicon-term">sexual</a> health and relationships book for young <a href="glossary.html#adults" title="People older than you who probably drive you batty.

Perimenopause, Menopause, Other Indignities and You -- A Guide</em></strong> (Hachette, 2021).</p>
<p>Heather has also been a sexuality, <a href="glossary.html#contraception" title="Devices, medications or behaviors used to intentionally aim to prevent pregnancy, including the condom, the cervical barrier, the implant, the patch, the pill, the rhythm method, the ring, the shot, the IUD, spermicide and withdrawal.

Heather is a previous member of the editorial board for the <em>American Journal of Sexuality Education and </em>the Board of Directors for NARAL Pro-Choice Washington, a writer and contributing editor for the 2011 edition of <em>Our Bodies, Ourselves</em>, and their young adult sexuality advice was previously syndicated at <a href="http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/">RH Reality Check</a> (now Rewire).</p>
<p>Heather has won numerous awards, including The Champions of Sexual Literacy Award for Grassroots Activism from the National Sexuality Resource Center/SFSU in 2007; in 2009 the winner of the Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality, Western Region's Public Service Award and the Our Bodies, Ourselves' Women's Health Heroes Award. In 2012, the Joan Helmich Educator of the Year award, and in 2013, The Woodhull Foundation's Vicki Award, for affirming sexual freedom as a fundamental human right. In 2015, Heather received the Steinem-Waters Award, given to a movement leader over 30 who has exhibited a consistent investment in developing young people in the field of reproductive justice, as well as the Golden Brick Award, recognizing their significant contributions to the field of sexuality education in the Untied States. They were also a lead plaintiff in the ACLU vs. Gonzales case, arguing against the Child Online Protection Act (COPA), which could have removed young adults' access to needed sexuality information, and Heather's work with Scarleteen -- and the import of our service -- helped secure an important win for the case.</p>
<p>Their work at Scarleteen and in sexuality education and activism has hailed acclaim or attention from numerous publications, including <em>The Utne Reader, The City Pages, Alternet, The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Siren, The Industry Standard, The Chicago Tribune, CNN, The Chicago Tribune's RedEye, The Nation, Feministing, The Minnesota Women's Press, The Boston Phoenix, Ms. Magazine, The New York Times, HipMama, Bust, Bitch, The Minneapolis Star-Tribune, the Oxygen Network, Estronet, Yahoo!, Lavender Magazine</em>, and <em>The Woman's Guide to Sex on the Web</em>. Heather has been quoted in numerous articles about sexuality, appeared on many radio shows, and has lectured and given workshops and trainings at many youth and adult conferences, colleges, schools, clinics, bookstores and other community gatherings. Heather is also a member of the Association of Reproductive Health Professionals.</p>
<p>Their essays, fiction, poetry and artwork have appeared in their own publications as well as in <em>Teen Vogue</em>, <em>The Guardian (UK), RH Reality Check </em>(now<em> Rewire</em>) <em>Issues Magazine, PIF Magazine, Maxi Magazine, </em><em>Women's Studies; An inter-disciplinary journal</em>; in the anthologies <em>Yes Means Yes: Visions of Female Sexual Power and A World Without Rape, Viscera, The Adventures of Food, Aqua Erotica, Zaftig: Well-Rounded Erotica, The Mammoth Book of Best New Erotica 1 &amp; 2, Shameless: An Intimate Erotica</em> and <em>Penthouse</em>.

Heather has been quoted in other sexuality books, such as <em>The Whole Lesbian Sex Book</em> and <em>The Mother's Guide to Sex</em>, and their work has been used in a number of university, school and clinic curricula.</p>
<p>Heather was previously a classroom educator and taught in the Montessori method (AMS), and created and ran an independent preschool from 1992 - 1996. A graduate with honors of Chicago's Academy for the Arts, where they studied music and creative writing, Heather won a National Academy of Poets award in her teens. They continued their education at Shimer College, studying literature and sociology, then later studied at the Midwest Montessori Teacher Training Center. In addition, Heather is trained as a facilitator for <a href="http://www.teentalkingcircles.org/">Teen Talking Circles</a>.</p>
<p>Heather is navigating middle age with as much grace as they can muster, and currently lives and works both on a rural island outside Seattle, Washington and in Chicago, Illinois. When not working themselves into an early grave, they can be found playing with their dog, hiking, communing with nature, making music, dreaming up art, and crafting tasty vegetarian delights in the kitchen while loudly crooning tunes from 70's AM radio, all of which the people who love them graciously tolerate without making too many jokes at their expense.</p>

<h4><strong>Sam</strong> <strong>Wall, Assistant to the Director:</strong></h4>
<p>Sam started on her path towards Scarleteen as a <a href="glossary.html#LGBTQ" title="L = lesbian, G = gay, B = bisexual, T = transgender, Q = queer or questioning. Additional letters sometimes added include U = unsure, I = intersex, P = pansexual, A= asexual, S = straight allies.
" class="lexicon-term">LGBTQ</a> advocate and peer educator at U.C Davis in 2009. She went on to write a sexual health column for <em>The California Aggie</em> and work for U.C Davis Health Education &amp; Promotion as a sexual health educator. Sam found Scarleteen via Tumblr in 2013, and knew instantly she wanted to be a part of the organization. She joined the team as a volunteer and was thrilled to be brought on as staff in 2015. She answers message board and SMS/text questions, manages social media, writes advice columns and articles, and performs in-person sex ed for parents and young people alike. Sam holds an MSW from U.W Madison and is a Licensed Social Worker. She has experience as a <a href="glossary.html#rape" title="When one person does a sexual act to, on, or inside another person who does not want to participate; who refuses to participate and/or who does not or is unable to fully and freely consent to take part in that activity." class="lexicon-term">rape</a> crisis advocate/counselor and youth services facilitator. When not doing sex ed, Sam can be found playing roller derby, hiking with her spouse and wiener dog, raising carnivorous plants, writing about cryptids, or pointing out all the things wrong with modern dinosaur movies. She is a contributor to the recently published anthology <i>Youth Sexualities: Public Feelings and Contemporary Cultural Politics</i>. Her non-Scarleteen writing can be found at <em>Death and The Maiden</em> and <em>Autostraddle</em>.</p>

<p><small><em><img alt="" src="../sites/files/scarleteen/STcampgroup2018.png" style="margin: 10px; width: 400px; height: 319px; float: left;" /></em></small></p>
<p><small><em><strong>Scarleteen Team Camp, 2018: </strong>left to right: Eli, Alice, Heather, Ruby, Sam, Chlöe, Siân, Mo, Jacob, Al.</em></small></p>
<p><strong>Al</strong> has used and loved Scarleteen since they were a sad and sexually confused preteen. They are currently working as a health educator on a college campus, and their favorite thing about being a burgeoning sexpert is constantly telling people, "yeah, that's totally normal". They are a firm believer in strong coffee, letting yourself grow, and watching bugs.</p>
<p><strong>Alice </strong>found Scarleteen while writing a sociology paper on the politics of sex education, and loved what she found. After being a Scarleteen fangirl from afar for a few years, she began working with the organization, mostly in direct service. She also runs the Scarleten Instagram. She deeply believes that everyone has a right to comprehensive, progressive, and inclusive sex education. Along with doing health education, Alice is a preschool teacher. She loves collaging, swimming, and watching coming-of-age films.</p>
<p><strong>Ashleah</strong> is a social worker who just wants to talk about sex! She loves working with teens and advocating for their rights to access to sexual healthcare and have quality education. Ashleah has played the role of prevention educator several times and has always used Scarleteen to inform her work. When Ashleah is not obsessing over sex &amp; sexuality, she is on Pinterest planning her life, interpreting her dreams, or cooking meals with her son. She also enjoys superheroes (but thinks the villains are better), mythical beings and the supernatural.</p>
<p><strong>Chanté</strong> is a Scarleteen evangelist. Her professional background entails Organizational Development, Social Innovation, Health and Well-being and Community Engagement.  She holds a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) from Mount Mercy University and an M.A. from St. Catherine University in Saint Paul, MN. She has spent the last 15 years dedicated to the RJ movement -- her career began at Planned Parenthood and thereafter she went on to serve as Director of Parent Programs &amp; Community Outreach at MyHealth (formerly West Suburban Teen Clinic), joined forces with the Hennepin County Teen Parent Connection and continued to serve as a mentor and volunteer sex educator. Chanté is also founder of <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.thedarkesthorse.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1554580676700000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG4pKbCZGTYcxhzXrY26n6xjU2O9A" href="http://www.thedarkesthorse.com/" style="color:#1155cc" target="_blank">The Darkest Horse</a>, a digital media production company that spotlights on women, minorities and underrepresented leaders in tech. This new project arose from her fierce dedication to diversity, equity and inclusion. She is a proud mother of twin boys and resides in Chicago with her family.</p>
<p><strong>Edith</strong> is a relentless dreamer and globetrotter by choice. Always moving from one place to another with no more than her computer, camera, dog, memories and some music. You can find her having long conversations with the moon at midnight. Edith came to Scarleteen because she truly believes in the power of education, has always had questions and loves places that have answers. She loves art, books, coffee and choices, and believes in the possibility of a better world where, one day, everybody will feel safe enough to smile, dance, love and be loved. <em>(currently on leave)</em></p>
<p><strong>Isabella</strong> Rotman, our artist-in-residence, is a Chicago cartoonist and illustrator from Maine who truly cares about your genital well being. She is the author of the <a href="glossary.html#queer" title="In the context of sexuality, a broad term for sexual orientation that can describe any number of orientations which are not heterosexual. People who identify as queer may be bisexual or pansexual, gay or lesbian, questioning, asexual or more. " class="lexicon-term">queer</a> and quirky sexual health book<em> You’re So Sexy When You Aren’t Transmitting STDs</em> and a recent graduate from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Other than educational comics, Isabella’s art is usually about the ocean, mermaids, crushing loneliness, people in the woods, or sex. If any of the above interests you then you may enjoy her self published comics or blog ThisMightHurt.Tumblr.com.</p>

<p><strong>Jacob</strong> has been with Scarleteen since 2007 and they were a teen. They are based in Leeds in the UK and are a youth worker, with additional geeky powers who works in community sexual health, and have another job in digital healthcare. They support young people on the message boards, especially on issues of relationships, <a href="glossary.html#abuse" title="Purposeful harm or mistreatment of another person, which can be verbal, emotional, physical or sexual. An ongoing pattern or cycle of such mistreatment or harm can characterize an abusive relationship.
" class="lexicon-term">abuse</a> and queer <a href="glossary.html#identity" title="The defining character or personality of an individual; who we feel like we are as a person. Identity is often used to talk about sexual identity -- who we are as sexual people, which can include things like our sexual orientation, our preferences and things we like and want in sex and sexuality, our sexual politics -- or gender identity, who we feel we are and identify as (even if only to ourselves) in terms of our gender." class="lexicon-term">identity</a>. They contribute written content, occasional graphics and frequent bad puns to the website. They do in-person outreach for Scarleteen in the UK. Also, they talk to cats, ride a pink bicycle and love making stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Mo</strong> is a long-time Scarleteen reader and supporter who started volunteering in 2013. He trained as a crisis response volunteer with the Orange County Rape Crisis Center of Chapel Hill and has been involved with several support &amp; social groups for trans* folks, both in central North Carolina and in the Bay Area. His areas of interest are varied, but usually center on <a href="glossary.html#gender_identity" title="A person&#039;s own sense of whether and in what sense they feel they might be a man, a woman, neither, a mixture of genders, or another gender entirely." class="lexicon-term">gender identity</a>, <a href="glossary.html#consent" title="To agree to do something or give permission.

In his spare time he can be found climbing the hills of San Francisco, making delicious food, or reading. He will happily talk your ear off about roller derby.</p>
<p><strong>Ruby</strong> decided when they were in middle school they'd be a sex educator (and was ruthlessly made fun of for it). They persisted, moving on to be part of a Teen Council through Planned Parenthood where she met Heather and found Scarleteen. Ruby is a student trying to figure out how to merge their interests of psychology, Deaf culture, sex education, and <a href="glossary.html#social_justice" title="An equitable distribution of advantages, assets, and benefits among all members of a society." class="lexicon-term">social justice</a>. Ruby is mainly a chat volunteer, and occasionally does outreach with Heather and intends on developing a translation of Scarleteen's comprehensive curriculum to American Sign Language. In her free time, Ruby enjoys walking, warm drinks, learning, laughing, and hanging out with her snake, Lulu.</p>
<p><strong>Stephanie</strong> has been volunteering for Scarleteen since 2008. She co-directs the SMS/text service, answers questions at the boards, and helps updating articles on the main site. Currently Stephanie is a Special Education and Sexual Education teacher for an Alternative School in the Johnstown area. She loves to travel and hopes to see the world.</p>
<hr />
<p>Beyond being incredibly valuable to us, our young adult volunteers also get experience of value to them by volunteering at Scarleteen. Here's what a few of them have to say about it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Scarleteen has been my virtual home-away-from-home for the past six years and counting, throughout many physical moves and positive life changes. I came for the information -- accurate, up-to-date, all-inclusive, and sex-positive -- and stayed for the community -- warm, welcoming, and worldly. It's currently about commitment for me -- I volunteer because, as I've said before, Scarleteen completely revolutionized the way I view sex and sexuality. Now I seek to help others feel that same sense of empowerment.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I like volunteering because I just freaking love it here. More specifically, I love the community aspect of it, the feeling that if all of us volunteers managed to get together in person, we'd probably stay up all night sharing stories, having awesome conversations, and laughing. It's also nice to know that I am far from the only person who cares about the issues we address here. I also love that I learn something new. Every. Single. Day. Whether it's a new fact, a new way of explaining something that makes it easier to understand, or a new perspective on something, I learn something every time I'm here.</p>
<p>I've also gotten started on a pretty awesome career because volunteering here helped me figure out what I was interested in, but that's just an added bonus, really.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I'm volunteering because Scarleteen's ethos of providing feminist, queer-positive, sex-positive and inclusive sex education to youth is what I'm passionate about, what I love to study, and what I need. I don't have access to any other public space where my whole sexual, messy, queer, curious self is encouraged and supported. By volunteering, I'm able to connect with like-minded others who believe that every human being has the fundamental right to honesty, knowledge, care and pleasure. Even though this is an online service, knowing that I am part of a shared project gives me the confidence to carry these conversations and this activist work into my day-to-day life.</p></blockquote>
