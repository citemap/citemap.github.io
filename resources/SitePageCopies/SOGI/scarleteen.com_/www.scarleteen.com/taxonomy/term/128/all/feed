If you have chronic pelvic pain, what do you do if you want to get sexual with yourself or someone else? How can you be physically intimate if you’re in pain? How do you talk to your partners? If it starts hurting, should you stop? This guide from Nicole Guappone offers some great help with all this and more.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;meta  itemprop=&quot;name&quot; content=&quot;Getting to Know Your “New Normal”: Tips for Sex When You Have Pelvic Pain&quot; id=&quot;md3&quot; /&gt;</description>

I&amp;#039;m a virgin. So I&amp;#039;ve never had sex. I just masturbate often. When I rub my clit for a while I get this amazing feeling and I can tell I squirt something out.  After that, I get tired and stop. I can make myself do this multiple times and I consider that cumming. Is it an orgasm though? Is that how it&amp;#039;s going to feel when I have sex?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>The Clitoris, the Vagina and Orgasm: Feelings and Frameworks</title>
    <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/article/advice/the_clitoris_the_vagina_and_orgasm_feelings_and_frameworks</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-name field-type-text field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;contributor&quot;&gt;lioness&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;meta  itemprop=&quot;name&quot; content=&quot;The Clitoris, the Vagina and Orgasm: Feelings and Frameworks&quot; id=&quot;md6&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-detailed-question field-type-text-long field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;I&amp;#039;m a lesbian in my early twenties and I&amp;#039;ve heard the idea of the &amp;quot;vaginal orgasm&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;clitoral orgasm&amp;quot; debunked here.  But I&amp;#039;m feeling confused about how to reconcile that with my experience that orgasms when I&amp;#039;m stimulated in different ways feel different.  Like, when just my clit is being stimulated, I come in one way, and when the walls of my vagina are being stroked, it&amp;#039;s like a different kind of orgasm builds up--from deeper inside.  The second kind tends to go on for longer, and be less &amp;quot;piercing&amp;quot; than orgasms where it&amp;#039;s just my external clitoris being stimulated. Generally, those second ones feel more &amp;quot;complete&amp;quot; too. Both kinds feel good--I&amp;#039;m not knocking either one--but saying one feels more clitoral and one feels more vaginal feels like an accurate description. Do other people have this experience?  

Also, I know Freud&amp;#039;s idea about &amp;quot;vaginal orgasms&amp;quot; being more &amp;quot;mature&amp;quot; than &amp;quot;clitoral orgasms&amp;quot; is all messed up. But I&amp;#039;ve heard some older women talking about orgasms coming &amp;quot;more from inside&amp;quot; as they got older. Is there any evidence or do you have any reason to believe that this is true for many women?

I guess part of what I&amp;#039;m asking is, &amp;quot;am I imagining this difference?&amp;quot; When I&amp;#039;ve read that the idea of &amp;quot;vaginal orgasms&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;clitoral orgasms&amp;quot; is BS, that&amp;#039;s seemed pretty cool and liberating. And yet, I do seem to experience these different kinds of orgasms. Can you help me understand all this?  Thanks a lot.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

I have been sexually active since I was 17. Every time I have sex whether I was in a relationship with them or not having sex hurt. When we first start to have sex it feels good, but after a few minutes it starts to hurt, feeling like the penis is hitting a wall. I can&amp;#039;t last for more than around 5 minutes or the sex feels like intense pain. Also I have never has an orgasm while having sex, I just do not feel aroused in the same way while having sex, like I do when my clit is being played with. People tell me I just do not have sex often enough so I am not &amp;quot;stretched out&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;used to it&amp;quot; but it does not feel good to me at all, except for the first minute or 2. I don&amp;#039;t understand why I don&amp;#039;t enjoy sex like the rest of the human population.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>Feeling pain or feeling nothing at all = my experience of sex.</title>
    <link>https://www.scarleteen.com/article/advice/feeling_pain_or_feeling_nothing_at_all_my_experience_of_sex</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-name field-type-text field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;contributor&quot;&gt;yougivemefever&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;meta  itemprop=&quot;name&quot; content=&quot;Feeling pain or feeling nothing at all = my experience of sex.&quot; id=&quot;md8&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-detailed-question field-type-text-long field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; itemprop=&quot;description&quot;&gt;I seem to not be able to feel any sort of pleasure from anything sexual. I&amp;#039;m 17 and have never been able to achieve an orgasm. It hurts being fingered. I&amp;#039;ve never been able to masturbate, because I could not keep focus or it started hurting. It also feels too awkward. When my boyfriend tried doing it, it hurt. He tried giving me oral sex, but that was painful. I tell him it hurts, and he tries to go as gently as he can, but it still hurts. I&amp;#039;m frustrated because I get no satisfaction, and my boyfriend&amp;#039;s self esteem is damaged because he thinks it&amp;#039;s his fault. We lost our virginities to each other a couple of months ago. It hurt a lot the first two times. After it stopped hurting, it just felt like nothing. I didn&amp;#039;t have the heart to tell my boyfriend until recently that I don&amp;#039;t feel anything. Now he&amp;#039;s really upset because he feels like a pig and that he used me. He says I subconsciously don&amp;#039;t love him, and that&amp;#039;s why I don&amp;#039;t feel anything. 

It seems like I&amp;#039;m the only one with the problem of not being able to feel anything during sex AND clitoral stimulation hurts. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Because I know a girl who has, and she said it was a TYPE 1 circumcision and that she couldn&amp;#039;t have sex EVER. Also, is there any way she will ever be able to reverse the mutilation? What limitations will she face, compared to a person who hasn&amp;#039;t been mutilated? Thanks a lot for your answer!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

I can orgasm easily like this, and have multiple orgasms if I keep going. I haven&amp;#039;t yet had sex that isn&amp;#039;t just me and myself, but I feel ready to do more physical things with my boyfriend, except I am worried that him touching me won&amp;#039;t feel like it does when I masturbate. It feels really different when I touch my clitoris with bare fingers, not really good at all. Am I too sensitive? What is going on? I don&amp;#039;t want him to feel bad about it. In fact I&amp;#039;d rather just not have sex with him at all if it won&amp;#039;t be good for both of us. Please help, I am stressing out about this.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
