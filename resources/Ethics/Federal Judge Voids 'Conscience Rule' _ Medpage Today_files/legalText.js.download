    "<li><p>In patients with CLL who followed the current (5 week) dose ramp-up and the TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures, the rate of TLS was 2% in the VENCLEXTA CLL monotherapy studies. The rate of TLS remained consistent with VENCLEXTA in combination with obinutuzumab or rituximab. With a 2- to 3-week dose ramp-up and higher starting dose in patients with CLL/SLL, the TLS rate was 13% and included deaths and renal failure. </li>" +

    "<li><p>Patients should be assessed for TLS risk, including evaluation of tumor burden and comorbidities, and should receive appropriate prophylaxis for TLS, including hydration and anti-hyperuricemics. Reduced renal function further increases the risk. Monitor blood chemistries and manage abnormalities promptly. Interrupt dosing if needed. Employ more intensive measures (IV hydration, frequent monitoring, hospitalization) as overall risk increases. </li>" +
