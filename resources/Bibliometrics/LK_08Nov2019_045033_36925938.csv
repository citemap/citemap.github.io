By examining how social contexts differentially modulate neurocognitive development; project findings may be useful in intervening with youth at risk for emotional; behavioral; or social difficulties. Relatedly; by investigating such processes as youth transition through puberty; project findings may highlight this developmental period as an effective point of entry for prevention and intervention efforts in deflecting upward trajectories of risk taking and problem behavior.","NIDA","9665708","22-MAR-2019","PA-13-302",5R01DA039923-05,5,R01,DA,039923,05,,"LLOYD, JACQUELINE","1-JUL-2015","31-MAR-2020","Psychosocial Development, Risk and Prevention Study Section (PDRP) ",,"10319450","TELZER, EVA HAIMO",Not Applicable,"04","PSYCHOLOGY","608195277","US","35.366248","-79.429394","578206","UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL","CHAPEL HILL","NC","SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES","27599-0001","UNITED STATES", ,"1-APR-2019","31-MAR-2020","279",Research Projects,2019,NIDA,377803,

Themajority of these youth receive no specialty mental health treatment during the hospitalization; and rates ofoutpatient mental health follow up after suicide attempt are low. Thus; the proposed research is designed toidentify best practices for promoting youth connection to ongoing mental health care and safety planning aftermedical hospital discharge; and to develop a toolkit to facilitate dissemination of these practices to medicalhospitals with different configurations of resources.","NIMH","9729068","13-JUL-2019","PA-16-198",5K23MH115162-02,5,K23,MH,115162,02,,"HILL, LAUREN D","1-JUL-2018","30-JUN-2022","Special Emphasis Panel (ZMH1-ERB-I (01))",,"12439340","DOUPNIK, STEPHANIE ",Not Applicable,"03","Unavailable","073757627","US","39.946633","-75.196603","1499101","CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA","PHILADELPHIA","PA","Independent Hospitals","19146-2305","UNITED STATES", ,"1-JUL-2019","30-JUN-2020","242",Other Research-Related,2019,NIMH,185710,

This study addresses the need to identify parenting interventions that are effective in promoting emotional and behavioral school readiness skills by implementing and evaluating the Reflective Parenting Program with ECE families in a community family service agency. Such interventions may be especially valuable for vulnerable families facing a multitude of adversities that may compromise caregiving; including stress associated with economic hardship or community violence.","NICHD","9502846","4-JUN-2018","PA-13-302",5R01HD078543-05,5,R01,HD,078543,05,,"GRIFFIN, JAMES","10-AUG-2014","31-MAY-2020","Psychosocial Development, Risk and Prevention Study Section (PDRP) ",,"9902179","PALEY, BLAIR ",Not Applicable,"33","NONE","092530369","US","34.071312","-118.443545","577505","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES","LOS ANGELES","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","90095-2000","UNITED STATES", ,"1-JUN-2018","31-MAY-2020","865",Research Projects,2018,NICHD,564390,

This study will provide a comprehensive picture of the pubertal; neurodevelopmental; and social psychological changes occurring during early adolescence; and their relationship to the emergence of mental health problems; so that modifiable; developmentally specific risk factors can be identified as targets for early intervention and prevention efforts.

There is a broad cost to society that accrues on a personal level in the loss of adult productivity and healthy maturation; and on a socioeconomic level in rising mental health care costs. Elucidating the effects of a structured cognitive behavioral and social skills training (CBSST) on the social and role functioning of youth at clinical high risk of psychosis will move us closer to targeted preventive interventions that have the potential to halt or ameliorate this neuropathological process and improve the outcome of this vulnerable population.","NIMH","9538834","11-JUL-2018","RFA-MH-14-210",5R01MH105178-05,5,R01,MH,105178,05,,"REIDER, EVE","26-SEP-2014","31-JUL-2020","Special Emphasis Panel (ZMH1-ERB-D (05))",,"1960560","ADDINGTON, JEAN M",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","207663915","CA","51.050110","-114.085290","605701","UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY","CALGARY","AB","Unavailable","T2N 1-N4","CANADA", ,"1-AUG-2018","31-JUL-2020","242",Research Projects,2018,NIMH,260214,

However; only 32% of those who need treatment initiate SU treatment services; a finding thatcontrasts sharply with the 76% initiation rate in the general adolescent population. Lack of family engagementdue to low motivation (associated with resistance; denial; lack of information) and logistical challenges (lack ofknowledge of options; funding; and transportation) are significant barriers to service engagement. Theproposed R34 study will integrate existing evidence-based tools for use with JJ populations and examine thefeasibility; acceptability; and preliminary efficacy of a caregiver-youth intervention aimed at increasing SUtreatment initiation. The intervention addresses two primary barriers to family engagement in treatment: lowmotivation and logistical challenges. Because families may experience one or both of these barriers;developing a customizable; adaptive approach designed to assess and address them is important. This R34application is significant because; if successful; it will reduce the sizeable gap in service initiation and receiptamong JJ youth by addressing family engagement?one of the largest contributors to the gap?and has thepotential to impact health outcomes for JJ-involved youth and their families.","NIDA","9807674","10-JUN-2019","PA-18-073",1R34DA049079-01,1,R34,DA,049079,01,,"ZUR, JULIA BETH","15-JUN-2019","30-APR-2022","Interventions to Prevent and Treat Addictions Study Section (IPTA) ",,"6797190","KNIGHT, DANICA K",Not Applicable,"12","MISCELLANEOUS","043807882","US","32.711703","-97.360526","8272601","TEXAS CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY","FORT WORTH","TX","ORGANIZED RESEARCH UNITS","76129-0001","UNITED STATES", ,"15-JUN-2019","30-APR-2020","279",Research Projects,2019,NIDA,218207,

Inother words; the problems that need to be solved to close achievement and social gapsare problems of development in context; and the solutions to these problems can onlybe found through research conducted in real-world settings that identify how children inpoverty engage with the developmental inputs in early childhood classrooms that aremost salient to helping them be successful upon entry into school.","NICHD","9617268","25-JAN-2019","PA-13-302",5R01HD051498-09,5,R01,HD,051498,09,,"GRIFFIN, JAMES","30-SEP-2005","31-DEC-2020","Psychosocial Development, Risk and Prevention Study Section (PDRP) ",,"8485510","DOWNER, JASON T ","WILLIFORD, AMANDA ","05","MISCELLANEOUS","065391526","US","38.034386","-78.519716","1526402","UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA","CHARLOTTESVILLE","VA","SCHOOLS OF EDUCATION","22904-4195","UNITED STATES", ,"1-JAN-2019","31-DEC-2019","865",Research Projects,2019,NICHD,593223,
