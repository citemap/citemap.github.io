This study utilizes comprehensive approaches to examine cross-sexhormone effects on the brain throughout the pubertal period and aims to improve long-term clinical outcomesfor transgender youth by elucidating how sex hormone therapy alters sex-specific risk for disease. Delineationof this paradigm also provides critical insight into the role of sex hormones in typical development and theirimpact on neural networks implicated in psychiatric disorders.","NIMH","9769144","31-MAY-2019","PA-15-261",5R01MH115349-02,5,R01,MH,115349,02,,"PACHECO, JENNI","23-AUG-2018","31-MAY-2023","Neuroendocrinology, Neuroimmunology, Rhythms and Sleep Study Section (NNRS) ",,"9594815","HONG, DAVID S",Not Applicable,"18","PSYCHIATRY","009214214","US","37.430351","-122.178210","8046501","STANFORD UNIVERSITY","STANFORD","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","94305-2004","UNITED STATES", ,"1-JUN-2019","31-MAY-2020","242",Research Projects,2019,NIMH,738226,

The U.S. National HIV/AIDS Strategy notes that transgender persons are at high risk for HIV infectionand yet efforts specifically targeting transgender populations have been minimal. In addition; transgender womenare at increased risks for sexual violence; mental health problems; and they are hindered by a lack of access totrans-friendly competent health care. To date there are limited HIV prevention/sexual health promotion programsthat have been developed for and evaluated with this population. To fill this unmet need this project will developa mobile app delivered multimedia interactive HIV prevention and sexual health promotion program developedfor transgender women that delivers the intervention as a series of interactive activities tailored to the user.Activities include those focused on sexual health; health; infrastructure constraints; and connectedness to othertransgender women. When complete; the resulting resource will provide a cost effective HIV/STI interventionthat can be implemented with transgender women across diverse settings with fidelity; while increasing uptakeand effective delivery by appealing to the target audience on their mobile device and ultimately reducing newHIV/STI infections and improving health among transgender women.","NIMHD","9796673","12-APR-2019","RFA-MD-18-009",2R44MD012279-02,2,R44,MD,012279,02,,"JEAN-FRANCOIS, BEDA","21-SEP-2017","30-SEP-2021","Special Emphasis Panel (ZMD1-XLN (J1))",,"8712017","KUHN, TAMARA J ","KLEIN, CHARLES HOWARD;SUN, CHRISTINA JIAYI","13","Unavailable","079336099","US","37.049400","-122.014130","10036415","DFUSION, INC.","OAKLAND","CA","Domestic For-Profits","94612-1917","UNITED STATES", ,"12-APR-2019","31-DEC-2019","307",SBIR-STTR,2019,NIMHD,668340,

Altering this trajectory is a public health priority. Yet; few evidence-based programs (EBP) exist for justice involved youth; and among those that do; implementation has been slow; challenging; and rarely sustained. Moving EBP into real-life settings is essential if their public health impactis to be realized. This study will compare two implementation strategies (peer-led versus probation staff-led) of PHAT Life; a uniquely tailored comprehensive risk reduction EBP for young offenders. Findings will provide much needed evidence of the effectiveness; cost-effectiveness; and sustainability of the two approaches in order to guide decisions regarding the most efficient use of limited resources. Moreover; both implementation strategies will build capacity in the juvenile justice system to deliver and sustain EBP.","NIMHD","9722069","12-JUN-2019","PA-13-302",5R01MD010433-05,5,R01,MD,010433,05,,"JONES, NANCY LYNNE","23-SEP-2015","30-JUN-2020","Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-AARR-G (02)M)",,"1908113","DONENBERG, GERI R",Not Applicable,"07","PUBLIC HEALTH & PREV MEDICINE","098987217","US","41.880320","-87.687749","577703","UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO","Chicago","IL","SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH","60612-4305","UNITED STATES", ,"1-JUL-2019","30-JUN-2020","307",Research Projects,2019,NIMHD,870065,

Adolescence is a critical developmentalperiod; with the social-emotional skills and health-related behaviors that emerge during this time serving as afoundation for future well-being. While the majority of the world?s adolescents live in contexts of adversity;many of which can be found in low- and middle-income countries; only a fraction of the research on adolescentpsychosocial development has been conducted in these settings. Successful prevention strategies targetingyouth living in contexts of adversity require an understanding of the co-occurring emotional and behavioralrisks that signify underlying psychosocial vulnerability; as well as the social environments that exacerbate andbuffer these risks. Further; there is a need for studies across low-; middle-; and high-income countries toassess the contextual generalizability of key factors in adolescent psychosocial development. Finally; mixedmethods approaches can enrich such investigations by providing a more comprehensive exploration ofpsychosocial risks in adolescence than would be obtainable from relying solely on one set of methods.To fill these gaps; the proposed research will use data from the multi-country Global Early AdolescentStudy to: 1) characterize typologies of psychosocial risks among early adolescents; and explore whether thesetypologies vary by gender and urban setting; 2) assess associations between these typologies and key socialenvironmental risk and protective factors; and 3) qualitatively explore the meanings that adolescents in oneurban setting ascribe to risk behaviors based on membership in different typologies. The proposed researchaligns with the NICHD?s priority to study psychosocial adjustment for individuals in high-risk environments.","NICHD","9833858","15-AUG-2019","PA-18-671",1F31HD100161-01,1,F31,HD,100161,01,,"ESPOSITO, LAYLA E","1-SEP-2019","31-AUG-2021","Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-F18-Z (20))",,"15783564","FINE, SHOSHANNA LEAH",Not Applicable,"07","OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONS","001910777","US","39.298737","-76.594342","4134401","JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY","BALTIMORE","MD","SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH","21205-1832","UNITED STATES", ,"1-SEP-2019","31-AUG-2020","865",Training; Individual,2019,NICHD,45016,

However; only 32% of those who need treatment initiate SU treatment services; a finding thatcontrasts sharply with the 76% initiation rate in the general adolescent population. Lack of family engagementdue to low motivation (associated with resistance; denial; lack of information) and logistical challenges (lack ofknowledge of options; funding; and transportation) are significant barriers to service engagement. Theproposed R34 study will integrate existing evidence-based tools for use with JJ populations and examine thefeasibility; acceptability; and preliminary efficacy of a caregiver-youth intervention aimed at increasing SUtreatment initiation. The intervention addresses two primary barriers to family engagement in treatment: lowmotivation and logistical challenges. Because families may experience one or both of these barriers;developing a customizable; adaptive approach designed to assess and address them is important. This R34application is significant because; if successful; it will reduce the sizeable gap in service initiation and receiptamong JJ youth by addressing family engagement?one of the largest contributors to the gap?and has thepotential to impact health outcomes for JJ-involved youth and their families.","NIDA","9807674","10-JUN-2019","PA-18-073",1R34DA049079-01,1,R34,DA,049079,01,,"ZUR, JULIA BETH","15-JUN-2019","30-APR-2022","Interventions to Prevent and Treat Addictions Study Section (IPTA) ",,"6797190","KNIGHT, DANICA K",Not Applicable,"12","MISCELLANEOUS","043807882","US","32.711703","-97.360526","8272601","TEXAS CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY","FORT WORTH","TX","ORGANIZED RESEARCH UNITS","76129-0001","UNITED STATES", ,"15-JUN-2019","30-APR-2020","279",Research Projects,2019,NIDA,218207,
