The U.S. National HIV/AIDS Strategy notes that transgender persons are at high risk for HIV infectionand yet efforts specifically targeting transgender populations have been minimal. In addition; transgender womenare at increased risks for sexual violence; mental health problems; and they are hindered by a lack of access totrans-friendly competent health care. To date there are limited HIV prevention/sexual health promotion programsthat have been developed for and evaluated with this population. To fill this unmet need this project will developa mobile app delivered multimedia interactive HIV prevention and sexual health promotion program developedfor transgender women that delivers the intervention as a series of interactive activities tailored to the user.Activities include those focused on sexual health; health; infrastructure constraints; and connectedness to othertransgender women. When complete; the resulting resource will provide a cost effective HIV/STI interventionthat can be implemented with transgender women across diverse settings with fidelity; while increasing uptakeand effective delivery by appealing to the target audience on their mobile device and ultimately reducing newHIV/STI infections and improving health among transgender women.","NIMHD","9796673","12-APR-2019","RFA-MD-18-009",2R44MD012279-02,2,R44,MD,012279,02,,"JEAN-FRANCOIS, BEDA","21-SEP-2017","30-SEP-2021","Special Emphasis Panel (ZMD1-XLN (J1))",,"8712017","KUHN, TAMARA J ","KLEIN, CHARLES HOWARD;SUN, CHRISTINA JIAYI","13","Unavailable","079336099","US","37.049400","-122.014130","10036415","DFUSION, INC.","OAKLAND","CA","Domestic For-Profits","94612-1917","UNITED STATES", ,"12-APR-2019","31-DEC-2019","307",SBIR-STTR,2019,NIMHD,668340,

This is likelychanging during adolescence as we become sexually mature via pubertal development and requires that weperceive peer faces in new ways (e.g.; as romantic partners). Our goal is to understand how both behavior andbrain reorganize to accommodate these changes; which will have relevance for understanding how faceperception is disrupted in so many disorders (e.g.; social anxiety; depression; schizophrenia; bipolar disorder;autism) that effect social interactions and relationships with other people.","NIMH","9692798","23-JUL-2019","RFA-MH-17-300",5R01MH112573-03,5,R01,MH,112573,03,,"SIMMONS, JANINE M","26-JUN-2017","30-APR-2022","Special Emphasis Panel (ZMH1-ERB-S (01))",,"9929794","SCHERF, KATHRYN SUZANNE",Not Applicable,"12","PSYCHOLOGY","003403953","US","40.802628","-77.860551","1524202","PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK","UNIVERSITY PARK","PA","SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES","16802-7000","UNITED STATES", ,"23-MAY-2019","30-APR-2020","242",Research Projects,2019,NIMH,674913,
