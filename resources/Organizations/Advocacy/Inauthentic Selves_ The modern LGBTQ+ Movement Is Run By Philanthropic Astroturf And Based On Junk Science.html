It is the recent Anchorage municipal elections. It is cold, it is chilly, it’s Anchorage, and there are municipal propositions: one of them is about local cops being able to issue parking tickets. There’s also Proposition 1 (Prop 1), which attracted $900,000 in spending, dwarfing every other election by a country mile.</p><p id="bc86" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">What’s Proposition 1?</p><p id="613c" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Prop 1 was put forward by an organization called ‘Alaska Family Action’, and the aim of Prop 1 was to make bathrooms, once again, sex-segregated instead of being based on self-declared gender identity. Anchorage’s bathrooms had been segregated by gender identity since 2015. The left-leaning media reacted in cacophony against this new ‘bathroom bill’, and hundreds of thousands of dollars from reasonable people flowed into Anchorage to defeat a municipal ordinance proposal that would harm trans people. Common sense and reason won, and the liberal project continued, with the rights of transgender people to use the bathroom, re-affirmed.</p><p id="d043" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Except those ‘reasonable people’ don’t exist. Not in any great number.</p><p id="cf8e" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">See, after spending a very long weekend combing through campaign filings from both Alaska Family Action and ‘Fairness for All — Vote No on Prop 1’, it became clear that the vast amounts of money spent on the election by Fairness For All didn’t come from normal, ordinary Americans. Even though transgender people are supposedly a persecuted minority that need civil rights, Vote No on Prop 1 out spent and out raised Alaska Family Action by around $710,000. In total, Vote No had $828,000 at its disposal. Its campaign filings reveal that a large majority of this money came from a set of lobbying groups almost from central casting: The Human Rights Campaign (HRC), Freedom for All Americans (FFAA), Planned Parenthood (PP), and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Large, federally based organizations poured money and staff into a small municipal election, all to fight ‘bathroom bills’. They flew in representatives from the National Center of Transgender Equality to help with ‘story telling’, and The Transgender Law Center provided consulting services. They made sure volunteers were well fed — ACLU makes many filings throughout for providing catering at events for volunteers. FFAA paid for a slick website, and a subscription to campaigning software Blue State Digital. A local Anchorage ad agency was hired and paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce campaign material. Vote No spent as much on campaigning collateral as Alaska Family Action did on their whole campaign, and even more than that on TV ad buys. While there were many small donors, the clear majority of the money came from large organizations, such as Planned Parenthood and the Human Rights Campaign, among others who also provided the Vote No access to their mailing lists and campaign databases, which is also visible in their campaign filings.</p><p id="92ec" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Despite outspending their opponent 8 to 1, carpeting Anchorage in television ads, mailers, and phone calls, and the support of federal level political organizations, the result was only 5% in Vote No’s favor. This is indicative of that Vote No bought an election — no one outspent that heavily should even dream of getting within a 5% margin yet Vote Yes got within striking distance having spent an eighth of the money. This came as a surprise to me. I have seen a lot of elections and votes. This was one of the oddest. Because one of the catch-cries of the trans movement is that they are the most ignored and the most marginalized group in America, yet can outspend its electoral opponents by orders of magnitude. That doesn’t sound like the most marginalized group in America. I wouldn’t think the most marginalized group in America would have a well-funded lobby group behind them. One capable of outspending the Christian Right on an 8–1 basis. Something doesn’t add up.</p><p id="b046" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Despite the supposed status of transgender people as America’s most oppressed minority, the North Carolina ‘bathroom bill’, H.B 2. was international news. How many other state bills become international news? Celebrities said they would no longer come to the state, sports teams protested. Bruce Springsteen said he wouldn’t play there. Every boycott by some famous liberal was greeted with aplomb. There was a national shaming of the state, on the massive stage that is the mainstream news cycle. Left unmentioned by that same mainstream news were the changes to North Carolina employment laws also in the same bill, that negatively impacted working-class Americans, or the fact some of the outcry was defining sex under North Carolina law as<em class="hf"> “the physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person’s birth certificate”.</em> Bruce Springsteen didn’t refuse to play in the state based on that part of H.B 2. When the ‘bathroom bill’ sections were removed in 2017, the employment sections did not change. There was a collective shaking of heads, a throwing up of hands, a celebration of transgenderism’s victory and the bill disappeared from the national conversation.</p><p id="6fae" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Transgenderism, as a movement, has experienced a rapid rise compared to any other civil rights movement. Sex change surgery only went beyond experiments or the unfulfilled whims of Roman Emperors until the 1950s, a decade that brought us the term ‘transsexualism’ courtesy of those that treated Christine Jorgensen, who was still unable to marry men because their legal sex was still listed as male despite their sex reassignment surgery. In that time, it has gone from a freakshow curiosity and the surgical treatment for the homosexuals (who were popularly believed, into the 1960s to be a sort of ‘third sex’, and often still are outside of a Western context), to America’s most pressing civil rights movement, with hundreds of millions of dollars being poured into the issue across the fifty states.</p><p id="5cf4" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">By contrast, other civil rights movements have not enjoyed such a rapid rise. Women, oppressed since the creation of private property, have endured patriarchy for thousands of years. It took a hundred years for the United States to abolish slavery, and another hundred to abolish segregation. It seems it will take another hundred for people to abolish what Colin Kaepernick kneels over. Homosexuals have been increasingly marginalized in Western society since late antiquity and after the Stonewall riots and the collective awakening in the 60s and 70s, have waged a 50-year long fight for equal rights — one that has not yet been won, as homosexuals have no federal civil rights protections. Yet transgenderism, a term itself coined barely twenty years ago, and included in ‘LGBT’ since only the mid-90s has money to burn and victories seem to come easily .</p><p id="dea0" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Does this add up to you?

I decided to find out, and doing that in modern America requires following the money. And the money leads to large philanthropic foundations and pharmaceutical money.</p><p id="ef46" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">See, trans movement, separate to the gay and lesbian movement, has built itself an entire infrastructure over the past ten years. ‘LGB’ has morphed into ‘LGBTQI+’. One Canadian school district managed to morph the ‘LGB’ acronym into ‘LGBTQITTIPASFDASFAARP’ (or something similar) which led to a round of healthy internet mockery. <mark class="oe of jd">The transgender movement is not marginalized voices finally being heard; it is a case of large amounts of money being heard.</mark> According to Funders for LGBTQ Issues (FFLI), funding specifically earmarked for transgender causes began rapidly increasing in 2012; by 2016 it outstripped the funding for gay, lesbian and bisexual combined (a total of $13.2m), at a cool $22 million total in funding, specifically earmarked for transgender causes. That’s over 10% of the total LGBTQI funding tracked by Funders, which is $202m total.</p><p id="2baa" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">That the money comes from a wide range of philanthropists: while names such as George Soros’ Open Society Foundation, Arcus (run by gay Stryker Corp heir Jon Stryker) and Tides come as little surprise to anyone following money on the center left of politics. But other names stand out: Jennifer Pritzker, (formerly Col. James Pritzker) who came out as a trans woman in 2013, through their Tawani Foundation, who outside of transgender causes, is a far-right Republican and supported Trump-supporting candidates in the 2016 election. This has come as specifically earmarked funding for gays and lesbians has declined in the same period — foundation and philanthropic funding for lesbians was a not-so-cool $4 million in 2016, despite being a far larger population than transgender people. Overall, LGBTQI+ Funders reports over $202m in total philanthropic funding for LGBTQI+ organizations in 2016, and much of this funding is simply a donation to organizations who campaign for a broad variety of issues. 39% of funding goes towards Advocacy — given the huge focus of LGBTQI+ organizations on transgender issues, they are likely getting a more disproportionate slice of the pie than the figures show. As funding specifically for gay men and lesbian women has stagnated or declined in the same period, transgender funding has increased year on year, from $3m in 2010 to $22m in 2016.</p><p id="fa8b" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">But some gay and lesbian critics contend that there has been too much focus on the T.

That version of the bill in 2007 had the chance to pass in a Democratic majority Hill — it died in the Senate. As of 2018, the bill has still not been passed and millions of gay and lesbian Americans do not have federal civil rights protections. Aravosis is confused: he does not know why the transgendered have to be included the gay and lesbian movement. The ‘T’ only began to be included in the mass media around 2003. The rapid expansion of the acronym has taken place over only the past decade.</p><p id="ec87" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">If we are to look at the state of other things in 2018, this confusion over the ‘T’ has turned into a clearly articulated critique, whose articulators are often derided as ‘radical exclusionary gays’, or more popularly, ‘Trans-Exclusionary-Radical Feminists’.

Sometimes, the application of that deadly-four-letter acronym, which often serves as a scarlet letter in the ‘queer community’, the relabeled version of ‘gays and lesbians’, can simply come from a lesbian stating she is not into penises. The harsh way these critics are treated — and turned on for having an opinion, that often amounts to ‘lesbians don’t like penis’ is ridiculous. This insane level of criticism is not some asshole in a gay bar or on trans activists on Twitter, but is often instead published by large media corporations, supported by left-leaning political infrastructure.

I picked it out of a Funders For LGBTQI Issues list. It is a small organization, that somehow made a presentation to the UN, and it didn’t think to conceal its donors in its IRS 990 forms. So, I combed through them. Their Wikipedia page tells me it’s executive director is Mauro Cabral, a trans and intersex activist, who was a signatory to the Yogyakarta Principles. Sounds totally organic and not artificial. Its mission is, supposedly,</p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="adb6" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">““GATE’s mission is to work internationally on gender identity, gender expression, and bodily issues by defending human rights, making available critical knowledge, and supporting political organizing worldwide. GATE envisions a world free of human rights violations based on gender identity, gender expression and bodily diversity, and transformed by the critical inclusion of those historically marginalized on those grounds. We will contribute to building powerful, expert and well-resourced political movements, able to have meaningful participation in global processes and to transform the landscape of socioeconomic justice worldwide.””</p></blockquote><p id="66a8" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">The Wikipedia page also tells me that the organization was founded in 2009. The Wikipedia citations for both that, and the mission statement lead to dead links. A quick perusal of the GATE IRS 990 forms reveals a focus around ‘depathologization’, which it describes as:</p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="344c" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em class="at">“</em>Coordinating an international initiative focused on the ICD-11 revision and reform, supporting processes of legal depathologization and advocating for the identification of pathologization as a ground for human rights violations”</p></blockquote><p id="b32e" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">What this translates to, in other words, is a goal of considering gender dysphoria no longer a mental illness — and to consider gender dysphoria a mental illness as a ground for violating a trans person’s human rights. This could mean that with no diagnosis, doctors cannot be sued for malpractice for prescribing transition. Do you see an issue with that? Other focuses of GATE include “Movement building”, which is described in its 2015 IRS 990 form.</p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="0ee5" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">“MOVEMENT BUILDING — ADVOCATING FOR TRANS, GENDER DIVERSE AND INTERSEX ACCESS TO AVAILABLE FUNDING AND FOR THE CREATION OF NEW FUNDING SOURCES” [sic]</p></blockquote><p id="a04d" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">The goal: making funding available to trans people in order to achieve these goals. Where does that money come from? Who are the funding sources? How will they be created? The 2015 form also mentions aiding in international HIV response. But crucially, I have saved the best for last. GATE betrays its actual astroturf nature with this admission in its 2015 IRS 990.</p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="9683" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">“Global Action for Trans Equality INC does not have program service activity to report on for 2015 due to receipt of its first round of funding into the organization mid-December”.</p></blockquote><p id="003f" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">The organization was not founded in 2009 like the Wikipedia page would like to tell us. The earliest publications on its website date to 2013. It received its first round of funding in 2015, and the organization was set up that year, according to its tax returns. Where did that money come from? Its 2016 IRS 990 illuminates us. Unlike many organizations I investigated, GATE did not bother hiding who its primary donors are on its publicly available IRS forms. On its website(which is literally transactivists.org), it proudly states it is sponsored by two large philanthropic organizations: The Open Society Foundation, and The Arcus Foundation.</p><p id="9e93" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Open Society donated $523,000 to GATE, and Arcus $130,000. This was followed up by a grant of $150,000 by the Fidelity Charitable Trust, which often handles anonymous charitable donations for people of largesse. It then received a $103,000 grant from the US State Department during the Obama administration.</p><p id="f673" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Does this sound like an innocuous, grassroots organization to you — or is there an astroturf rat abroad the GATE ship? I smell the astroturf rat. It stinks, so I’m surprised you can’t smell it. GATE offers a raft of publications for the keen reader, including its ‘Joint Trans Language Submission to UN Independent Expert SOGI.’ (SOGI: Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity). An astroturf group, presenting evidence to the UN, purporting itself to be representative to the wider community, is not ‘activism’. But it’s done in the name of the LGBTQI+ community. Those endless articles and research? Another marker of astroturf. By the way — you will see the names ‘Open Society’ and ‘Arcus’ repeatedly throughout the entire article. Why? Because GATE isn’t the only organization they fund. Their tentacles are everywhere.</p><p id="514a" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">GATE is not the only example of astroturf. Another example is the <a href="https://transequality.org/" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">National Center For Transgender Equality</a>, with its widely-cited US Transgender Survey. But the NCTE isn’t exactly a grassroots organization either. Founded by Mara Keisling, a trans woman, in 2003, Keisling’s biography on the website specifically states it was founded to provide a <em class="hf">“professional activist presence in Washington for transgender people”</em> and was started with the aid of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. Keisling herself became an activist after transitioning in her early 40s, after working in social marketing and public opinion research, and is the child of Bill Keisling, who is a former chief of staff to former Pennsylvania governor William Scranton. Keisling’s biography also credits Keisling with leading a coalition of ‘400 LGBT rights organizations’, called ‘United ENDA’, which prominent transgender activist Dana Beyer, <a href="http://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/11/06/10-years-later-firestorm-over-gay-only-enda-vote-still-remembered/" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interviewed in the <em class="hf">Washington Blade</em></a><em class="hf">,</em> credited with making sure <em class="hf">“there have been with few exceptions […] no instances of any gay activism or legislation that did not include trans people.”</em> The biography then goes on to outline NCTE’s more recent work: the US Transgender Survey, which is forming the basis of transgender policy around the world, and then lists her media appearances.</p><p id="5cad" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Let’s drill further into the NCTE, shall we? Looking through the NCTE’s 2016 tax return, we find that it received a total of $1,066,962 in contributions and grants, and a similar number for the 2015 financial year. It paid $897k of that in salaries, and $335k in ‘other expenses’ leaving the organization $175k in debt.

It also let us know that nearly a third of the NCTE funding went on two executive director salaries, those salaries being of Keisling and Lisa Motett, both of whom are paid six-figure salaries. No contributors are listed on their tax returns for financial years dating back to 2014, but it received $711,000 from ‘foundations’ in financial year 2015. Why cover up donors who are supposedly donating to a human rights cause?</p><p id="6a98" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">It takes looking at the<a href="https://transequality.org/issues/national-transgender-discrimination-survey" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> lauded NCTE survey</a>, the National Transgender Discrimination Survey(NTDS) which is downloadable from their website, to put the puzzle pieces together over where their funding comes from. While the largest share of funding came from an ‘anonymous donor’, the rest are standard names: The Arcus Foundation, the Gill Foundation, the Human Rights Campaign, and the Tides Foundation among others. The survey has become one of the most cited trans studies in the world. It is regurgitated to politicians by professional activists, forms the basis for governmental and health policy, has its stats posted in Twitter arguments, and is regarded as sacrosanct among the trans community.</p><p id="adfd" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Except the survey, despite its six figure costs, contains numerous methodological flaws. It is a survey where the sample was built on self-selection. The sample isn’t random. Amusingly, the survey, which was run online, had as its first question ‘have you already taken this survey before?’, and warned that taking the survey repeatedly would not increase the number of entries into a prize draw (you can view a screenshot <a href="https://sexnotgender.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/ustranssurvey_haveyoutakenbefore.jpg" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>). That meant the survey could have been taken over and over again by the same person. It was also meant to provide US-based statistics, but had no restrictions on of which country the survey could be taken from. That’s not a valid dataset. That’s not even going to pass an undergraduate statistics course. Supposedly NCTE cleaned the dataset, but I am not sure how you can clean a survey with such flaws. It should only serve as an indicator for further research at best, not a bible or a reason to bring about legislative change. It brings into question every statistic in the survey. Other criticisms were that it tried l<a href="https://sexnotgender.com/2015/09/16/u-s-trans-survey-and-methodological-flaws-or-garbage-in-garbage-out/" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">eading participants into a particular response.</a></p><p id="26e7" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">It is an issue because the survey has gone on to shape public policy and be cited by numerous other organizations. The survey, which is incredibly flawed, has been cited numerous times by other associated transgender lobby organizations — the Human Rights Campaign, the Transgender Law Center, the National LGBTQ Task Force, a litany of other lobby groups and the Democratic Party, all groups that use its statistics as crucial evidence for their argument that transgender people are the most oppressed minority in America. Despite its methodological flaws, it was published, and proudly sponsored and cited by a number of corporate and philanthropic foundations. This was also used by groups funded by these organizations as electioneering material”, and for lobbying purposes — to <em class="hf">advance an agenda</em>. But if the survey is flawed as it is, why not try and find better statistics? And why use bad statistics to advance an agenda? And this is not the only example of bad transgender statistics. After all this is not the only statistical error that is commonly cited. For example, you may read that trans women are more likely be assaulted in a men’s prison. This comes from a California study, which used a convenience sample of transgender women in California’s prison system, and then compared that convenience sample to a sample of the general prison population, which is to put it mildly, a statistical abortion.</p><p id="3f0e" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">But they are not the only groups that are or have become astroturf. <a href="http://www.nclrights.org/" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The National Centre for Lesbian Rights </a>(NCLR) was one of the biggest receivers of philanthropic funding in 2016, receiving $2.6m. Displayed prominently on the NCLR website is its legal director, who now identifies as a man (Shannon Minter), and a pledge towards transgender service members. In fact, outside of the name, I saw nothing specifically lesbian when I loaded up the webpage. I even tried using ‘Ctrl-F’ which showed me one total mention of ‘lesbian’ on the entire homepage that wasn’t part of the name of the organization. According to its 2016 IRS 990, it received $4.6m in grants. It spent most of that on salaries and wages. It does not include Schedule B of the IRS 990 form on the publicly available copy. The NCLR annual report has no donors listed, leaving their identities unknown. Given that the supposed ‘National Center For Lesbian Rights’ mentions lesbians once on its entire page, and not at all in its subsections, but has three different sections for transgender legal cases, the phrase ‘lesbian erasure’ and the word ‘subverted’ come to mind. Perhaps that is needlessly suspicious?</p><p id="4b6d" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Maybe not. The NCLR organized its first ever boycott in the history of the organization, of the Michigan Womyn’s Festival (or Michfest), a musical festival which made clear it was for people with female anatomy only and excluded transgender women.

It tells us those anonymous donors donated more than $100,000 — by how much is an exercise left to the reader. The annual report also thanks its corporate partners, which include the liquor company Bacardi, pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences (which manufactures PrEP drug, Truvada), a gaggle of banks, cable channels or providers as well as Hilton Hotels.

It looks like an invading force establishing a beachhead.</p><h2 id="fbd3" class="hl hm co at as hn ho hp hq hr hs ht hu hv hw hx hy" data-selectable-paragraph="">Lies, Damned Lies, and Statistics</h2><p id="be21" class="gh gi co at gj b gk hz gm ia go ib gq ic gs id gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Money is constantly flowing down the donation pipe for trans issues: <a href="https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2018/3/15/bound-for-inclusion-how-a-new-funder-group-supports-trans-communities" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a glowing <em class="hf">Inside Philanthropy </em>article </a>on a <a href="http://www.lgbtfunders.org/" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Funders For LGBTQ Issues </a>(FFLI) initiative details the creation of <a href="https://www.lgbtfunders.org/initiatives/gutc/" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Grantmakers United For Trans Communities</a> or GUTC. GUTC’s goals are supposedly capacity building, increasing the number of funds available for transgender people. The article actually contradicts FFLI’s own studies on the issue, saying that transgender funding forms a ‘small part’ of overall funding, despite the fact it outstripped the gay, lesbian, and bisexual combined in 2016, and has done so since 2014.

We are told by an Arcus representative, Jason McGill, the vice-president of Arcus’ social justice programs, that “Transgender leaders and their movement have been dramatically underfunded.” This is despite clear evidence that compared to other LGBT groups, they are not.</p><p id="0f64" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Suspiciously, the article chooses to cherry-pick its statistics. Despite the 2014 and 2015 reports from Funders For LGBTQ Issues being available, which show dramatic increases in transgender funding, Buzzfeed cites the reports that date from 2011 through to 2013. Cherrypicked statistics are very much a repeating pattern when it comes to transgenderism. The article tells us that transgender people “have been used as scapegoats” by “conservatives” who oppose “LGBT non-discrimination laws” and bring up the dreaded “men in women’s bathrooms”. It tells us that this is happening while <em class="hf">“homicides of transgender women in the US have doubled in the past 12 months”.</em></p><p id="f4f4" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Doubled? What did it double from? I decided to verify this, and GLAAD (remember an acronym now devoid of meaning) gave me the answers. So, how many homicides of American transgender people were there in 2016? I am sure you are waiting with bated breath for some kind of titanic, earth shattering number that will have you click ‘exit tab’, and bitch about my bullshit article on Twitter. Okay, here it is:</p><p id="68a0" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="gj hk">27.</strong></p><p id="6930" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">That’s not a typo. It really is 27. The number of total murders in the US in 2016? 17,250, and disproportionately trending black and male. 27 is 0.15% of murders in the US. In terms of figures, the Williams Foundation did a survey and estimated the number of trans people at 0.6% of the US population. The US population is estimated at 325 million at time of writing, which results in a figure of 1.95 million trans people across America.</p><p id="ff58" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">We’ll take 1.95 million Americans. If we figure how many trans people are victims of murder a year as a percentage, that figure is <strong class="gj hk">0.0013%. </strong>Per capita,<strong class="gj hk"> </strong>that’s a ratio of 1.3 trans people murdered per 100,000. The murder rate of women in the US is triple that, and of men, quadruple. Even with an extremely conservative estimate of 0.1% of the US population (or 325,000 trans people), we have a murder rate of 8.3 per 100,000. The murder rate of Chicago is twice that conservative figure at 16.02 people murdered per 100,000. In terms of gross numbers — that’s 11,535 murders of male Americans, and 3,292 murders of female Americans in 2017. 27 is small potatoes. That is not a murder epidemic — in fact it’s a murder rate per capita lower than Canada. It certainly doesn’t mean that there’s an ‘epidemic of transphobic violence’. That’s not something to campaign about — you’ve got it better than literally everyone else. Even if we use the Human Rights Campaign estimate of 750,000 trans people, which is half the 0.6% number, we get a murder rate of 2.7 per 100,000. That’s not a high murder rate. That’s lower than every other demographic in the US.</p><p id="9668" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">There are more bad statistics though. That same article tells us that <em class="hf">“globally 1,700 transgender murders have been reported, in the </em><strong class="gj hk"><em class="hf">past seven years</em></strong><em class="hf">, according to Arcus data”</em> [emphasis mine].</p><p id="44c4" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Your eyes immediately drift to the ‘1,700’ figure, and don’t see the 7 years, do they? That’s why I bolded it. If we take the 0.6% estimate of trans people in the US and apply it globally to a population of 7 billion people, we get 42 million people. 1,700 divided by seven years gives us a grand total of 242 murders a year. That amounts to 0.003 murders per capita of trans people, worldwide, every year. That’s definitely not an epidemic. In fact, that’s a global murder rate lower than every other category on earth. The murder rate per capita of unicycle-riding clowns is probably higher. To #StopTransMurders would be to eliminate the homicide of an entire group of people, which no nation has been able to accomplish. Ever.</p><p id="659d" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Maybe you think 42 million trans people on this earth is too big a number. So, we’ll make the figure 5 million people. A murder rate of 242 per year of a group of 5 million people is still a per capita rate of 4.84 — roughly similar to the US overall murder rate of 4.7. And that’s with a hugely conservative number that I literally pulled out of thin air. All these figures say the same thing — <strong class="gj hk">there is no trans murder epidemic</strong> — and philanthropic groups and their funded organizations supporting trans rights and sympathetic media have to perform statistical sleight of hand to even make such a proposal look even the slightest bit true. For comparison, the highest murder rate in the world belongs to Honduras, which had 90.4 homicides per 100,000 in 2017. That’s a violent epidemic. To add — the majority of those 27 killed? Black prostitutes. No middle-aged white trans women were killed at all (<a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2018/03/07/transgender-activist-trial-oakland-triple-murder/" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">though some did commit murders</a>) yet they are the ones bleating about #StopTransMurders and working in activist organizations. And the sex-work and transgender lobby does not seem to care about those vulnerable prostitutes, beyond using their names and deaths as a political prop.</p><p id="0dc1" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">If you’re wondering about the gay and lesbian side of things, rather than the transgender epidemic that doesn’t exist, yet is talked about so heavily, the FBI reports in its latest Hate Crimes report state that 16.7% of hate crimes were motivated by sexual orientation. 1.7% were motivated by gender-identity bias. Of the 1,255 victims targeted by sexual orientation, 62.7% were anti-gay male, 21.6% were LGBT (mixed group), and 11.7% targeted towards lesbians. There were 131 victims of ‘gender identity-bias’, 20 of whom were simply ‘gender-non-conforming’. In terms of hate crimes (which is criminal offenses carried out motivated by bias, not necessarily violent) gay men are disproportionately over-represented among the LGBT. That’s an actual disproportionate epidemic of violence — rather than the trans murder epidemic that doesn’t exist.</p><p id="1208" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">When was the last time you saw <em class="hf">that</em> on BuzzFeed?</p><p id="ff9c" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">But this is not the only ‘transgender murder epidemic’ article on Buzzfeed.

I looked into the source it cited, and the murder rate doubled from 12 murders to 24 murders. That figure comes from ‘The National Coalition Of Anti-Violence Programs’, counting between Transgender Days of Remembrance. That’s an even lower figure than the GLAAD data! And it is not just Buzzfeed. LGBT news sites, the left-leaning media, the list goes on — a quick Google search leads to more repeating of the meme ‘trans murder rate is high’. In fact, I googled ‘trans murder epidemic’ and got 535,000 results from Wikipedia, to the Human Rights Campaign, to ‘America’s transgender murder epidemic: why is nothing being done?’ from a UK website called ‘<em class="hf">Blasting News’</em>. It even appears as the beginning of the National LGBTQ Task Force’s 2016 annual report, highlighting its #StopTransMurders campaign. But the facts and figures say there isn’t an epidemic. Rather the opposite — trans people have the world’s best murder statistics, as a group. The ‘epidemic’ is easily debunked using LGBTQI+ groups’ <em class="hf">own statistics. </em>The trans murder rate is a false meme worthy of inclusion in a late 90’s chain email promising you the truth about Bill Clinton and Whitewater. It’s literal fake news. Why do this? Why frighten a small minority more, and why use it as a brickbat to obscure violence against gays and lesbians?</p><p id="f5c9" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Where does the money come from, the money that keeps up a healthy supply of this fake news?</p><h1 id="91fb" class="ih hm co at as hn eg ii ei ij ik il im in io ip iq" data-selectable-paragraph="">RICH MAN’S WORLD</h1><p id="a2a0" class="gh gi co at gj b gk hz gm ia go ib gq ic gs id gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">As I’ve gone through organizations, I’ve pointed out who provides them with funding. The primary funders of the transgender movement are large philanthropic foundations. Political lobbying often comes from them. One issue with identifying donors is that they are often not listed on IRS forms given to the public, nor identified in annual reports. Occasionally you will find a donor celebrated in a press release. I have tried to be as true and accurate as possible in my reporting despite these obstacles. Another issue is that a lot of money comes through the Tides Foundation, which has been accused of being ‘charity money laundering’.</p><p id="a947" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Effectively, what Tides Foundation does is receive funding from corporations, people of largesse, or philanthropic foundations, and then donates that funding for those groups or individuals, but in the name of The Tides Foundation. This effectively anonymizes those donations. If you see ‘Tides Foundation’ on a charity return, that money could have come from the Aliens of Epsilon Beta — and you’d have no idea. When you can’t find out who is funding your supposed community organizations, that should be a cause for concern. With that said, let’s dive into the names we can know.</p><p id="ce85" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">One name that comes up frequently and will continue to do so is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Pritzker" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Col. Jennifer Natalya Pritzker</a>, a trans lesbian, who transitioned in August 2013. Heir to the Hyatt Hotel fortune, Pritzker funds both transgender and far-right causes through their Tawani Foundation. Notably, Pritzker donated millions of dollars to the Gender And Sex Development Program, a transgender youth clinic in Chicago launched in 2013, by providing the money used to start the program. The Gender And Sex Development Program is run by one Robert Garofalo, who will be mentioned later on. Pritzker also provides funding to the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), and has also donated to GLAAD, among other large LGBTQI+ organizations.Apart from t their transgender donations, Pritzker is extremely right-wing. Alternating their occupation between ‘Retired’ and ‘Tawani Enterprises Inc’ on FEC returns, Pritzker donated hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars, to the Republican Party and its candidates in 2016, including state parties and the ‘National Draft Ben Carson For President Committee’. Perhaps Pritzker wishes GLAAD to debunk anyone saying the pyramids were not grain silos. To balance this all out, Pritzker gave small donations to Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat. SuperPACs Pritzker donated to include the American Future Fund, which has received funding from the Koch Brothers, and Bruce Rassetter (who runs the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.) Pritzker donated $33,900 to the Republican National Committee in April this year. While organizations Pritzker donates money to (like GLAAD, and the Task Force) have sessions about coping with the President, Pritzker gives money to Trump’s re-election campaign. Pritzker has been criticized by other transgender activists like academic Dean Spade for astroturfing the ‘transgender military service’ issue (I would note that many of the organizations I investigated had the military service issue prominently featured on their websites.)</p><p id="a0dc" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph=""><a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Open Society Foundations</a> (OSF) are the largest philanthropic organization in the world. Chaired and funded by hedge fund maestro George Soros, its size as the largest philanthropic organization has meant that it is the target of many conspiracy theories. Some of those theories may not be without validity. Soros is extremely active politically, not just through the Foundation, but also through various political groups and donations that run into the millions of dollars, mostly on the left of the political spectrum. After a Russian intelligence-linked hacking group, Fancy Bear, stole OSF documents, it was revealed Soros had been emailing 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton with campaign advice personally. The Foundation has spent over $11 billion since 1993 and has the largest endowment of any foundation in the world. Soros himself is also controversial for shorting the British pound in 1992, among other currency bets, such as the Thai baht in 1997. Open Society Foundations are supposedly decentralized and the boards running operations are autonomous. This ignores the fact that all activities carried out by the OSF are funded by one man. You can tell me Ford is decentralized and autonomously runs its operations in a variety of countries — they are still run by the same board, with the same objective: sell Ford cars. And while it insists it doesn’t follow a top-down approach of funding organizations… it does. It funds organizations and sponsors them — we’ve already seen that before. The Open Society Foundation doesn’t just leave activism to its many astroturf tentacles. A quick browse of their website gives you the lowdown on what they believe. Pushing for gender markers on legal documentation or ‘self-identification laws’ are a prominent part . This is pushed through a project called <em class="hf">License To Be Yourself</em>. It tells us of this burning issue with the following:</p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="683e" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">“When trans people’s passports, driver licenses, and national ID cards, do not reflect their gender identity, it can exclude them from fundamental aspects of daily life — like receiving health care, schooling, housing, or a bank account. And it can prevent trans people from exercising basic liberties like the right to vote or freedom of movement.”</p><p id="1ef9" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">The vast majority of trans people around the world cannot obtain official documents under their appropriate name and sex that match their gender identity. Where this is possible, trans people often face highly restrictive laws or regulations for changing name and sex that violate human rights obligations. These restrictions may involve excluding trans people who are married or have children or require compulsory medical diagnoses or procedures[sic], including those that result in sterilization.</p><p id="9c7a" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">“License to Be Yourself documents some of the world’s most progressive and rights-based laws and policies that enable trans people to change their gender identity on official documents. It shares strategies that activists have successfully used in a variety of global and legal contexts, and features case studies from Argentina, Australia, Hong Kong, Kenya, Ukraine, and the United States.”</p></blockquote><p id="93db" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Self-identification has been criticized by feminists for <a href="https://morningstaronline.co.uk/a-c509-sex-matters-1" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">essentially making legal sex meaningless</a>, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/we-transgender-women-cannot-self-identify-our-sex-wglh6srw3" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as well as by transgender people themselves</a>. What the OSF is advocating is that someone should be able to obtain official legal documents declaring them the other sex, without any form of medical treatment, based on self-declaration of ‘trans’ status. That’s clearly nonsense.</p><p id="7df1" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">The issue with the OSF is that its founder has a clear political agenda — and his vision must be enacted by his foundation, for better or worse. A pattern of Soros heavily investing into astroturf organizations to further his political agenda has been noticed by anti-drug campaigners. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-proposition64-cash-snap-20161102-story.html#" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">An article</a> in the <em class="hf">LA Times</em> describes how billionaires put large amounts of funding behind the legalization of marijuana too, highlighting the 2016 Proposition 64 to legalize marijuana in California. Yes, George Soros is involved with that. Anti-legalization campaigners have complained of being out-gunned and outspent, often by astroturf organizations that amount to little more than an election filing and a billboard. The money comes from large federal organizations and billionaires, not locally, and outspends the competition by a country mile. Sound familiar?</p><p id="ee86" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Yet another name to add to the list is Jon Stryker. An heir to Stryker Corp, the medical supplies company, he is the gay founder and president of the Arcus Foundation, which has given millions of dollars to the transgender cause over the past few years. His fingerprints are all over organizations like GATE, the NCTE, and The Transgender Law Center, all of which advocate for the same pro-trans policies in unison. Arcus has faced complaints from Catholic organizations that it used it’s grants to the Religion Newswriters Foundation, accusing it of using its money to manipulate the news and content produced by organizations it donates to. It also opens and runs centers to train ‘thought leaders’ in Arcus-approved policies and research.</p><p id="a83b" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Philanthropy and philanthropic initiatives have long histories of social intervention. Dating back to days that captains of industry such as Rockefeller and Carnegie walked the earth, the goal would be to spend their vast amounts of funds on solving problems, through research and implementing a desired solution. That many social problems originate from their ability to hoard wealth does not appear to occur to the philanthropist, who continues, nonplussed, with implementing his vision for the world, not through charisma or popular appeal, or via democratic means, but by throwing around money. These foundations operate tax free in the US.</p><p id="e8f9" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Essentially, the modern philanthropist does not research to solve a problem; he has a predetermined solution in mind and desires research to support his opinion, rather than funding research to form an opinion. It’s like wanting to score a touchdown late in the fourth, using a specific play, and repeatedly calling that play trying to score, regardless of defensive scheme. This comes through grants to existing non-profit organizations, or through creating new ones that look grassroots — astroturf. See our friends NCTE or NCLR and GATE, respectively, who produce research and reports that seem designed to reach a specified conclusion. Because organizations are effectively created or hired, the power in the relationship is held entirely by the philanthropist, who expects return on investment. Essentially, with their vast funding and reach, they strangle any form of actual grassroots organization with ease. Because their research predominates, it becomes the orthodoxy among the chattering classes. This is not simply donations to non-profits in the case of transgenderism — it is donations to universities and hospitals, which then produce scientific research of questionable validity, given that bias is inextricable from this situation.</p><p id="05f6" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">It’s not just trangenderism.</p><p id="40aa" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Probably the most famous example of philanthropy, astroturf, and a predetermined vision coming together is charter schools. Foundations from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to the Waltons, to a laundry list of wealthy family foundations have taken on the specter of American public schooling. Supposedly, if education were at the whims of the market, it would function more efficiently. These philanthropic experiments often target minority groups — the poor, racial minorities, and poor racial minorities (after all, if it doesn’t work,<em class="hf"> </em>it wouldn’t affect the children of the philanthropist, just people who don’t matter). Targeting resource starved organizations, they benefit from the completely imbalanced relationship between patron and client, because school districts with a large funding shortfall are not going to say no to millions of dollars. Of course, astroturfing takes place in this philanthropic area of interest. Take this example: The Gates Foundation needs support for its teacher effectiveness reforms. It pays a group called ‘Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors’ (essentially a company that creates ‘activist groups’ complete with the latest model of a Thought Leader), to create a group called ‘Teaching First’. The Gates Foundation went ahead with its ‘grassroots organization’ having launched in 2010, and called ‘Communities For Teaching Excellence’. <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/19/local/la-me-gates-group-20121019" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">It went belly up in 2012, having accomplished nothing</a>. Of course, we would not know about this dastardly behavior had the document planning this little excursion <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/answer-sheet/teaching%20first.1.pdf" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">not leaked in 2011 </a>and been splashed all over the media. The leaked document contained such gems as encouraging the organization to participate in campaigns not related to their goal in an attempt to look more authentic.</p><p id="61af" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">The Gates Foundation got frustrated at this point. So, it started funding other non-profits that agreed with them, dispatched paid staff to those non-profits, and suddenly saw a wealth of success. After all, if a bunch of different groups with obscure funding (remember in an IRS 990 you don’t have to disclose your donors) start saying the same thing, they must be right, right? But it is not only the Gates Foundation that does this. Other philanthropic organizations, run by people with similar views, donate to the same groups. The Gates, the Waltons, and others all donated to one group called ‘Parent Revolution’, for example.</p><p id="108f" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">There are other examples — a push by the Gates Foundation emphasized smaller schools, and they put $1 billion into the project, creating a nationwide trend towards smaller schools. But as with all modern philanthropy, they put the cart before the horse — the results were no different than a bigger school. Rather than figuring out which means would best bring about required ends, the philanthropist implements his own, untested means — a vision for how things ‘should work’, in his eyes, on a large population, able to simply because of vast funds, rather than democratic consent.</p><p id="dd91" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Astroturfing isn’t exclusive to philanthropic foundations. A famous leaked memo from the Phillip Morris tobacco company (from one John F. Scruggs, from an advertising company to one David Nicoli) illuminates astroturfing in all its phony glory. To quote the entire memo, because of its relevance:</p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="2162" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">““TO: David Nicoli DATE: December 18, 1998 FROM: John F. Scruggs RE: THE “ECHO CHAMBER” APPROACH TO ADVOCACY. This responds to your request for a memo explaining my proposed strategy for utilizing polling research, particularly in the upcoming excise tax fight. I have described this as the “echo chamber” approach to advocacy. This approach attempts to cause favorable information to resonate with and from various sources in order to increase its credibility with the target audience. As you are well aware, Members of Congress are impacted by multiple “influentials.” In fact, a number of studies have been done that attempt to rate the relative impact of these influentials on Members. A rough hierarchy has been established as follows, from most influential to least influential:</p><p id="88e7" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Constituents (unaided)</p><p id="0d4f" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Major Fundraisers</p><p id="3059" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Local Media</p><p id="b13d" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Colleagues</p><p id="acfc" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">National Media</p><p id="3bd6" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Advertising</p><p id="8cb9" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Lobbyists</p><p id="bda2" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">“The more a particular view or piece of information “echoes” or resonates through this group, the greater its impact. Grassroots efforts are so effective in modern day advocacy programs because they cause many constituents to repeat the same message to the target Member. Grasstops or “Influentials” campaigns work because those highest on the hierarchy scale, with the greatest degree of credibility, repeat the same or similar messages. You will note that the echo chamber effect can work in two different ways. First, the same message can reverberate among multiple sources toward the target Members. For example, the same information from polling data captured in a single poll can be repeated by the media, congressional colleagues, lobbyists and advertising. Second, similar but complementary messages can be repeated by a single source. For example, a media report that includes polling data as well as Bill Lilley research, comments from colleagues, and the text of advertising. Either the repetition or “piling on” approach provide the same result: enhanced credibility and influence of the essential message” [sic]</p></blockquote><p id="ca2e" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Does this sound familiar? The funding of various groups, all of whom apply political pressure, repeating the same message, over and over, to create an echo chamber where this is the only information getting to politicians and the general public?

Often, astroturfing occurs through the use of Twitter bots and on internet comment sections, paid commenters who repeat the same message ad nauseam, hoping to create a feeling to the reader that their opinion is mainstream. The legitimate reader may then propagate the message again, giving an air of legitimacy and authenticity to the message, and then what is a ‘meme’ in the Dawkins sense (though astroturfing can also be internet memes, as the world discovered when the House Intelligence committee released Russian astroturf election advertising a few months ago) becomes repeated over and over. People become afraid of being considered backwards or regressive, so they don’t question what ‘everyone’ seems to think. The original comments may have only been a few paid commenters posting under hundreds of different identities — that ceases to mean anything when their message is being promoted by hundreds of real people using their own online identities. Astroturf movements often train their own organizers: one such example on the left is the <a href="https://equalityfederation.org/" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Equality Federation</a>, which trains center-left LGBTQI+ ‘thought leaders’. It features six figure donations from the Gill Foundation and the Tides Foundation, among others. It is a name plucked out of a very large hat — there are dozens of other ‘Institutes’ and ‘Fellowships’ that train professional activists in professional Kool-Aid drinking across the political spectrum. Trained in drinking the ideological Kool-Aid, they further make the patron-client relationship more of a master-slave one. Professionalized into activism, it does not serve their interests to ever actually ‘win’, as with no issue to campaign on, they are out of work. They may be doing so unconsciously, but an ultimate victory would harm their chances at employment, leading to them favoring incrementalism and creating a cultural forever war. Even worse is if they question their beliefs — because that’s an entire career down the drain if they do.</p><p id="746c" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Critics do not fare well when criticizing the message of astroturf.

Doctors who agree with them are called quacks. The transgender movement has much in common with any other astroturf push by large philanthropic groups. If you want the right-wing version, simply look at the ‘Tea Party’ movement. Eventually, the movement was tracked down to two large right-wing think tanks — FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity, both funded by the Koch brothers. There were paid organizers, astroturf phrases such as the infamous ‘death panels’, and town hall debates with arranged altercations. Even grassroots groups on the left can become top-down organized — look at the Obama campaign, which took genuine grassroots support for his 2012 candidacy, and began arranging their logistics for them. But planned protests and a top-down astroturf approach are also present in the oil industry and the net neutrality debate. Pick an issue and you’ll find some plutocrat is pushing an agenda. The issue was highlighted even <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/how-grassroots-organizing-has-been-co-opted-78589" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">in <em class="hf">Newsweek</em></a>;</p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="f920" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">“It seems like the big thing that has changed is that historically, movements were made up of people who were disenfranchised; now they’re sponsored by insiders,” says Paul Frymer, a political scientist at Princeton. “They still have true activists attached to them, they just have a lot more help than they used to.” Much of that help now comes from the Internet.”</p></blockquote><p id="8bfe" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Amusingly enough, trans activists themselves have criticized the ‘trans in the military’ debate as astroturfing by Jennifer Pritzker.

The PAC lists some of its most prominent donors as Paul Singer, Tim Gill and Daniel Loeb. Tim Gill runs the Gill Foundation, another large LGBTIQ+ focused foundation that also makes large donations to many of the organizations mentioned and described above. If Paul Singer is a familiar name to you, it is because he is notorious for buying up Argentine debt and taking the country to court for a debt judgment, winning a judgment that allowed him to seize Argentine property in the UK. He continued harassing the country for repayment for years and made similar moves in the 90s with Peruvian debt. He has done this to multiple other nations. He opposes raising taxes on the 1% and parts of the Dodd-Frank Act. Outside of donating parts of his $2.8 billion fortune to LGBTQ+ causes, he is a large Republican donor, making donations to the National Republican Senatorial committee.

But what is transgender?<br> <br> “The word “transgender” — or trans — is an umbrella term for people whose gender identity is different from the sex assigned to us at birth.

I believe they refer to the concept of ‘third sex’ or ‘third gender’, which is often used to categorize effeminate male homosexuals, and occasionally butch women and allow them roles within a still patriarchal society, such as the Hijra or the Albanian Sworn Virgins. There were publications describing homosexuals as a type of third sex or ‘third gender’ in Western culture in the 1970s, so it is not something unfamiliar to America and wider Western culture. But the HRC doesn’t tell us what ‘gender identity’ is, nor why it is significant that is different from the ‘sex assigned at birth’.

To be clear, without identification, one cannot travel, register for school or access many services that are essential to function in society. Many states require evidence of medical transition — which can be prohibitively expensive and is not something that all transgender people want — as well as fees for processing new identity documents, which may make them unaffordable for some members of the transgender community. The NTDS found that among those respondents who have already transitioned, 33 percent had not been able to update any of their identity documents to match their affirmed gender.”</p></blockquote><p id="c8c5" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Accurate identity documents? That’s contradictory. While trans people supposedly have (inaccurate) legal documents, they are unable to access services that require identity documents because… they don’t have legal documents? Which is it? Do they have them or not? Some would contend they are accurate, because those documents record biological sex, not gender. Gender still hasn’t been defined in this article, by the way. What is gender, and why does it need to be affirmed? Supposedly, updating these requires evidence of a medical transition, rather than simply showing up and demanding changes to the sex marker on identification documents. How is the state to know who is truly trans and needs this information? What’s the burden of proof to prove that one is ‘truly trans’? Such laws would be easily exploitable — for example, a man declaring he is a transgender woman, making no attempt at transition, changing his documents, and accessing college scholarships intended to help women into college. How is he a woman? What is the criteria? Why should there be no criteria to determine a person’s legal sex? I am hopelessly confused.

In fact, it was explained on the front page of the multiple websites I looked at. In a single sentence: Gender is the sex stereotypes and roles that are prescribed to men and women under patriarchy, in order to perpetuate patriarchy. Doesn’t look too different to the definition of the HRC, does it? Now, think about every single mention of ‘gender’ to come, with that meaning in mind, and you’ll see what this may actually all be about.</p><p id="e042" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Because, from the horses mouth, being transgender is about identifying with the stereotypes and not being a stereotypical member of one’s own sex, then using modern medicine to fix this problem. This problem is fixed by treatments to cosmetically resemble the opposite sex. If I want to be a woman, all I need to do is identify as a woman. If I want to be a man, all I need to do is identify as a man. That is a tautology, and it is incoherent. It should not be the basis for a civil rights movement. The same logic can apply to being, for example, a white person who identifies as a black person, such as the infamous case of Rachael Dolezal. Even a toddler can point out that’s a nonsense argument. I have not made any of these quotes up — you can see this in the HRC’s transgender FAQ for yourself, if you want. This is dangerous. It presents gender stereotypes and gender as an innate thing to either sex, and that differing from them requires medicalization — hormone treatment and surgery, transition.

If stereotypes are what the transgender movement is about, this is only going to harm women and gay and lesbian and bisexual people — the people who have the most to lose by gender stereotypes being encoded in the law. It’s clear ‘gender identity’ is about which set of stereotypes one subscribes to, rather than some inborn trait that needs civil rights protections. The HRC is an authority and a national lobby group.

The story is that of Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT), and starts in the 1930s and 1940s .Christine Jorgenson was the first patient to receive HRT for transgenderism in the 1950s. It began its life being marketed as a cure-all, for the ills of menopause to the fountain of youth. It was also used as a tool to punish homosexuals, such as Alan Turing. Use for transgenderism was a side project carried out by a few doctors considered quacks and oddballs.</p><p id="7274" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">The most common use for HRT over the 20th century was instead to treat menopause. That particular train derailed in 2002, when the National Institutes Of Health’s Women’s Health Initiative, a large clinical trial to test HRT’s safety and efficacy, found out that HRT in women led to raised rates of strokes and breast cancer among other deleterious side effects. Lawsuits, particularly against the pharmaceutical company Wyeth (purchased by Pfizer in 2009), quickly followed, and the number of prescriptions of one of Wyeth’s most profitable medications dropped 66%. Overnight, HRT for menopause was no longer understood to be the automatic course of action. It later emerged that Wyeth and other drug companies marketing HRT had known about the risks but had deliberately concealed them to continue selling profitable drugs.</p><p id="504d" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">This caused some issues for pharmaceutical companies. Premarin, manufactured by Wyeth, was the best-selling drug of the 90s. HRT became accepted by women and physicians alike, and HRT was encouraged as safe and effective for menopause — which was untrue. It has been described as a time when patients request the medication, and physicians prescribed it, without checking on whether this medicalization of a natural process was needed or not. 42% of American women between the ages of 50 and 72 were on some form of HRT in 1999. Yet clinical trials instead proved that HRT was dangerous, and that the risks outweighed the benefits. And the prescription of HRT for menopause ended almost as quickly as it started.</p><p id="b6b0" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Pfizer, which makes the estrogen drug Premarin after purchasing Wyeth in 2009, is a major corporate partner of the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) and received a <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/featured_stories/featured_stories_detail/pfizer_earns_perfect_score_on_lgbt_ranking" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">100% score on the HRC’s Corporate Equality Index</a>. Wyeth was no stranger to targeting minorities for drug experimentation. In a suit filed and unsealed in 2010, a pair of former hospital sales representatives filed a whistleblower suit, alleging that Wyeth illegally promoted the Rapamune kidney transplant drug. Targeting African-Americans, Wyeth promoted off-label use of the Rapamune drug for use in other organs, when it was only FDA approved for use in kidney transplants. Representatives were provided with studies and abstracts to use when marketing the use of the drug off-label. Wyeth offered doctors and hospitals kickbacks when they prescribed Rapamune off-label. The FDA had actively warned against some of the promoted uses of Rapamune. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/wyeth-pharmaceuticals-agrees-pay-4909-million-marketing-prescription-drug-rapamune-unapproved" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wyeth later agreed to pay $490 million to the Department of Justice to resolve its liability.</a> Wyeth again engaged in unethical behavior with Prempro, another estrogen hormone replacement therapy drug, which is also used for transition. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-drug-research-ghostwriting/wyeth-paid-writers-to-promote-hormone-therapy-study-idUSTRE6865FQ20100907" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wyeth used ‘medical ghostwriters’ to build a brand around Prempro and various off-label uses of the drug.</a> What’s medical ghostwriting?

An academic is attributed authorship, even though they have not written the paper. The paper contains conclusions that support the pharmaceutical company’s marketing desires for a particular drug. In the case of Prempro, legal documents that emerged from a lawsuit brought by 14,000 patients were released to PLoS Medicine, an open access journal (viewable <a href="https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/drug/" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>). It revealed that Wyeth hired a medical communications company, DesignWrite, who then produced a first draft of a paper, received advice on a second draft from Wyeth, then sent it to an academic who would ‘author’ the paper by attaching their name and claiming authorship. Typically, the papers are review articles — they review a body of literature on a particular drug, then draw conclusions on its use. While the academics weren’t paid, political currency in academia has become the number of papers published in journals, so it added to their credentials. DesignWrite sold over 50 articles to Wyeth about HRT and produced conference posters and symposia materials. The material produced by DesignWrite promoted off-label uses of HRT. DesignWrite also promoted its advisory board creation and management capabilities to pharmaceutical companies.</p><p id="519e" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">While medical ghostwriting is clearly unethical, it’s not illegal. Because academic publications aren’t considered promotional, it does not fall afoul of off-label marketing laws. Pharma companies can ghostwrite as many articles as they like, building a message that the off-label use of drugs is safe, acceptable. They then publish that in an academic journal. Wyeth would produce studies that sang the praises of HRT for things it could never market it for, like curing wrinkles. Because the fact that the paper is ghostwritten is never disclosed, it means that people could potentially be receiving biased information that favors a drug company and using that when making decisions around patient health. If a large body of ‘research’ is promoting a use for a drug, then it must work, right?</p><p id="387f" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">How prevalent is medical ghost-writing,? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/11/business/11ghost.html" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The <em class="hf">New York Times </em>estimated in 2009 that 5–11% of medical articles are ghostwritten</a>, though this ultimately depends on the drug. With one drug (sertraline), between 18% and 44% of articles on the subject were funded and ghostwritten by Pfizer. But without disclosure, we do not know how prevalent the problem might actually be.</p><p id="6c44" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Disturbingly enough, similar evidence is beginning to come out regarding HRT in men, who have been sold similar stories about ‘Low T’ and testosterone therapy. Unlike HRT in women, this has not come through a large drug trial, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-abbvie-androgel-verdict-0328-story.html" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">but nearly 7,000 lawsuits</a>, directed at the makers of low testosterone treatments. Side effects include strokes, elevated risk of heart attack and blood clots.</p><p id="56f2" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">In fact, the makers of Androgel, AbbVie, were ruled against in a lawsuit brought by one Jesse Mitchell, described as a ‘bellwether’ case, to the tune of $150 million, for misrepresentation of the safety of their testosterone gel, Androgel. Mitchell suffered a heart attack after four years of using the gel, which was ruled to be directly caused by the Androgel treatment. AbbVie aggressively marketed Androgel on television, despite the fact that testosterone treatments were causing elevated rates of heart attacks.</p><p id="eaf0" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">The $150 million lawsuit was later tossed, but a second trial again ruled against AbbVie, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-abbvie-androgel-verdict-0328-story.html" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">awarding Mitchell $3.2 million </a>. 4,500 of the nearly 7,000 lawsuits involve AbbVie’s Androgel, which is considered the ‘Low T’ market leader. It is notable that AbbVie promoted the Androgel drug off-label. In fact, a former FDA head, David Kessler, <a href="https://dailyhornet.com/2017/ex-fda-chief-claims-abbvie-promoted-androgel-for-off-label-uses/" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">told jurors in an another testosterone lawsuit</a>, that he believes that AbbVie illegally promoted the testosterone supplement to aging men, without testing the safety of doing so. To quote his testimony:</p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="1afb" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">“What the companies in essence did was to take those indications of low testosterone in men for specific reasons [and] the company in essence broke that link,” “It was no longer [being marketed] for specific diseases; it was for low testosterone for a broad range of issues.”</p></blockquote><p id="12c7" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">The drug companies pushed to market the drug off-label, regardless of whether ‘Low T’ was a scientifically valid condition or simply the natural aging process.</p><p id="e43b" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">What relevance this does have to the transgender movement? Hormone Replacement Therapy is the primary drug prescribed for the treatment of transgenderism. It has a long history of illegal marketing, medical ghostwriting, and unethical behavior towards vulnerable patients.</p><p id="bf99" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Many of these same side effects have been reported in transgender people who take these drugs. For example, it is well known among female-to-male transgender people that after long periods on testosterone they require a hysterectomy, <a href="https://www.gires.org.uk/should-trans-men-have-a-hysterectomy/" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as they have higher risks for uterine cancer.</a> They also frequently experience incontinence and vaginal prolapse. Many trans women experience heart attacks and strokes. These side effects have been dismissed as hormone therapy is ‘necessary’ — so that this population don’t kill themselves. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16678333" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Surgery can leave MTF transgender people with urinary issues.</a> <a href="https://www.europeanurology.com/article/S0302-2838(04)00515-9/pdf" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">‘Gender affirmation surgery’ for both sexes often leads to incontinence and recurrent urinary tract infections.</a></p><p id="3462" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">HRT is prescribed and intended for the patient to take for life as they begin a journey into being their ‘authentic self’. A transgender person expects to take hormones for the rest of their life. This is significant because every drug prescribed for transgenderism is prescribed off-label. There are no approved drugs for treating transgenderism. Not puberty blockers, nor HRT. For transition, many of the drugs used by transgender people are common brand name HRT drugs that are being used off-label. Premarin, Androgel, and others. All of these drugs have histories of off-label marketing. Androgel as aforementioned has thousands of lawsuits pending against it. This history of pharmaceutical companies using illegal marketing practices and ignoring deleterious side effects can’t possibly be the case with transgender use, can it?</p><p id="c5f6" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Stephen Rosenthal, former president of the Pediatric Endocrine Society and transgender scientist media star and one of the primary researches on transgenderism describes this off-label status as a hurdle for puberty blockers <a href="https://www.healio.com/endocrinology/pediatric-endocrinology/news/online/%7Ba2eedc18-0009-4682-80dd-b259bc13b45a%7D/care-for-transgender-children-starts-with-affirmation-safety" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">in an article in <em class="hf">Endocrine Today</em></a><em class="hf">:</em></p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="902b" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">“One critical issue at this point in time is that none of the options for pubertal blockers on the market are FDA approved for transgender use. No pharmaceutical company has taken the steps necessary to change their labelling to include this category.”</p></blockquote><p id="d185" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">A look through the names of the scientists that study and promote transgenderism and the use of HRT to treat it, and you will see Rosenthal’s name repeatedly. You will also see other names repeatedly, particularly in transgender children research, and you will find the same group of people are always responsible for such research, such as Dr. Norman Spack, of Boston’s Children’s Hospital and Robert Garofalo, from Lurie Children’s Hospital in Chicago. Many of them only began producing research on transgenderism, particularly in children, during the past decade. For example, Rosenthal’s publications are on topics such as insulin metabolism until 2012, when his entire output becomes focused around transgenderism.</p><p id="fc62" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Later on, in that Endocrinology Today interview, Rosenthal states the following:</p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="19dc" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">“The Dutch, who really are the pioneers in this work, started treating kids with a group of medications called GnRH or gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. These medications have been used in the pediatric population for about 30 years now to very effectively treat kids with precocious puberty, kids who, at way too young an age, go through the full-blown pubertal process. … GNRH agents have been used for many years and have been found to be very effective and specific for blocking puberty in a completely reversible manner.”</p></blockquote><p id="91bf" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">This is contradicted by the fact that GnRH agents are currently the subject of multiple investigations for causing irreversible bone health problems, something Rosenthal does not acknowledge in this interview, but does in his research. <a href="https://khn.org/news/women-fear-drug-they-used-to-halt-puberty-led-to-health-problems/" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A recent news article</a> in <em class="hf">Kaiser Health News</em> found that many patients who had received Lupron in their formative years suffered numerous side effects. One woman had a hip replacement in her early twenties.</p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="cd76" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">“We want to provide advocacy that is informed and based on data, which shows that there has never been any example of a transgender person who has inappropriately behaved or interfered with the privacy of a non-transgender, cisgender person.”</p></blockquote><p id="d21a" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">This is both a clear lie and misinformation. Gender critical activists have collected screeds of news articles describing the exact scenario Rosenthal says does not happen. One project is literally called <em class="hf">‘This Never Happens’</em>. A study found that <a href="http://womanmeanssomething.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/A-Longitudinal-Analysis-of-Media-Reports-at-Target-Stores.pdf" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">when Target moved to gender-neutral changing rooms, incidences of voyeurism increased</a>. Who is telling the truth? Because according to Rosenthal, this exact scenario, which has happened often enough to make the news hundreds if not thousands of times, ‘never happens’. One defense that I have seen used is that such criminals aren’t ‘real trans people’. Perhaps they are also not true Scotsmen. He essentially proposes that transgender people, as a class, are incapable of behaving inappropriately, which is a ridiculous proposition worthy of ridicule. Rosenthal goes on to imagine a clear clinical process with a new type of medical specialist — the ‘gender specialist’, who will clearly form part of some kind of gender industry, is consulted when someone begins questioning their gender. Presumably, making a vast amount of funds in the process of doing so.</p><p id="e786" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">The doctors also make misrepresentations to the media, not just philanthropic foundations. Robert Garafalo <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/when-transgender-kids-transition-medical-risks-are-both-known-and-unknown/" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">made comments to PBS</a> about puberty blockers:</p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="8a31" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">“They allow these families the opportunity to hit a pause button, to prevent natal puberty … until we know that that’s either the right or the wrong direction for their particular child.”</p></blockquote><p id="2c2c" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Garofalo fails to mention the issues with using GnRH agonists in children. The article then goes on to say that <em class="hf">“The handful of studies that do exist suggest that gender dysphoria persists in a minority of children, but they involved very few children and were done mostly abroad”</em><strong class="gj hk"><em class="hf"> </em></strong>which is incorrect. The article then goes on to acknowledge that the use of puberty-blockers is off-label, and even concedes that such uses of the drug, considering the length of time it is used for, and the effects of stalling puberty, are totally unresearched. Another pediatrician at Lurie, Lisa Simons, admits this:</p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="b590" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">“We know that there’s a lot of brain development between childhood and adulthood, but it’s not clear what’s behind that.” What’s lacking, she said, are specific studies that look at the neurocognitive effects of puberty blockers.”</p></blockquote><p id="9003" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">The article then comments in a wish-washy fashion:</p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="8479" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">“Another potential dilemma facing transgender children, their families and their doctors is this: Taking cross hormones can reduce fertility. And there isn’t enough research to find out of it is reversible or not. So, when children make the decision to start taking hormones, they have to consider whether they ever want to have biological children.”</p></blockquote><p id="3f86" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">This is a clear lie. Failure to experience puberty (and no, cross-sex hormone administration is not a ‘correct puberty’ or a puberty at all), means the gonads never mature. Immature gonads, with immature gametes are <strong class="gj hk">never fertile.</strong> These children will grow up to be <strong class="gj hk">sterile</strong>. And there is no research into what taking these hormones for fifty years or more could do to a human body, <em class="hf">which is mentioned in the article</em>.</p><p id="146d" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Garofalo even admits he is using children as guinea pigs:</p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="b952" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">“I think those are the unanswered questions that really trouble me and can only be answered with long-term follow-up studies.”</p></blockquote><p id="2ed5" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Despite his unanswered questions Garofalo marches on, giving these drugs to children, drugs that will sterilize those children.</p><p id="437b" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Oh, here’s a fun fact the article also includes:</p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="0336" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">“Most of these treatments are still very expensive and often out of reach for people without the help of insurance.

The least expensive form of estrogen, a pill, can cost anywhere between $4 to $30 a month, according to Simons, while testosterone can be anywhere between $20 to $200 a vial.”</p></blockquote><p id="dc84" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Using these figures, and taking a ten-year-old child, the total cost of transition for a ten-year-old who takes puberty blockers until they are 16, is $86,400. There are 725 children being treated for gender dysphoria at Lurie’s, which gives us a figure of $62 million dollars over 6 years in Lupron prescriptions were all those 725 children starting to take puberty blockers right now.

Ehrensaft has not disclosed this as potential conflict of interest at all in either research or in media interviews. Given that she is promoting the use of AbbVie drugs in popular media through her own books that is extremely concerning. These scientists go out and promote the use of these drugs for transgenderism in popular media, arguing that it should be a civil right.

One must accept self-identification of the transgender individual at all costs. Thing is, that wasn’t accepted practice twenty years ago. For example, the British Royal College of Psychiatrists<a href="http://www.teni.ie/attachments/14767e01-a8de-4b90-9a19-8c2c50edf4e1.PDF" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> produced a 1998 report on childhood gender dysphoria</a>, which I quote below:</p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="32b4" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">“Gender identity disorders can be seen as states in which, in the course of the young person’s psychosexual development, there is an atypical gender identity organization.

For example, the rates of childhood gender dysphoria in girls outstripped boys over the past decade. A feminist would point out that patriarchy has more to do with which toys, games, clothing and objects are associated with a particular sex, or preferring playmates of the opposite sex (a child may simply want to play with the other children that like what they like), but it is clear that what is emphasized here is sex dysphoria, rather than ‘gender dysphoria’ — a dislike of physical sex, not of a particular assigned role. I have placed emphasis on the final conclusion: that sex dysphoric children usually turn out <em class="hf">homosexual</em>. In an interview, Rosenthal informs us that these studies were small and done mostly abroad. Yet, only twenty years ago, the British professional psychiatrists association was content to advise its membership that the vast majority of children who suffer sex dysphoria desist at puberty and mostly grow up to be happy homosexuals.</p><p id="d4bb" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">This is not a particularly novel conclusion. Gender non-conforming behavior during childhood is associated with homosexual behavior in adulthood. This has been replicated in large studies. What most studies find is that very few children with gender dysphoria grow up to be gender dysphoric adults — most grow up homosexual. If a cursory search of the literature on Google Scholar can turn up this fact, why are we so confused about childhood gender-non-conformity now? Perhaps there is merit to gender critical critics of transgenderism calling it ‘gay conversion therapy’ after all.</p><p id="1c1d" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">The paper is also interesting because it comments on the distinctions that need to be made between a presentation of transgenderism in childhood and in adulthood.</p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="c15a" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">“Similarly, pre-pubertal and post-pubertal groups need to be differentiated.

Phenomenologically there is a qualitative difference between the way such children and young people present their predicament from presentations involving delusions or other psychotic symptoms. Delusional beliefs about the sexual body or gender can occur in psychotic conditions but they can be distinguished from the phenomena of a gender identity disorder as outlined in this paper. <strong class="gj hk">There are issues of nosology because current classification systems seem to suggest that gender identity disorders in childhood are equivalent to those in adulthood and that the one inevitably leads to the other.

What research does the TransYouth Project churn out? I decided to go through some examples. I will quote liberally from the following research article: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28439873" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em class="hf">Gender Development in Transgender Preschool Children</em></a><em class="hf"> :</em></p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="ee2f" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">“[…] More recent theorizing, however, suggests that although full gender constancy knowledge may not be responsible for enhancing gendered preferences and behavior, understanding gender stability in particular is a central factor in motivating strong gender preferences (Ruble et al., 2007).

Once she discovers girls are stereotypically supposed to like dolls and pink, she likes them even more, because conformity is rewarded by our society.

Evidence that transgender children show strongly gendered preferences (perhaps as strong as controls) paired with a lack of gender stability beliefs (at least as it has traditionally been tested) could suggest that the “boost” from stability beliefs is not needed to show the high levels of gendered preferences observed by gender-typical children.”</p></blockquote><p id="59c9" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">What is gender? Is it, like the HRC says, sex stereotypes? Is it some inalienable psychological development that drives boys to like trucks and girls to like pink dollies?

Do they mean that the children’s understanding of stereotypes is stable?</p><p id="2abd" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">The paper then tells us this:</p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="7c73" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Despite the large body of work on gender development, most of that work has been conducted with gender-typical children.

Follow up studies on gender dysphoric children have been done: they turn out to be normal homosexuals.

Although typically focused on clinical outcomes (e.g., Cohen-Kettenis, Owen, Kaijser, Bradley, &amp; Zucker, 2003), these research teams have occasionally reported on basic gender development, much as we do in the current study with socially transitioned transgender children. For example, one study found that while siblings of gen-der nonconforming children preferred to play with toys manufactured for children of their sex, gender nonconforming children (Mage= 7.6 years) did not — they equally preferred toys manufactured for their own sex and the other sex (Zucker, Bradley, Doering, &amp; Lozinski, 1985). In contrast, for games, gender nonconforming children actually expressed a preference for games manufactured for the other sex, but their siblings did not. Thus, it appears that gender nonconforming children’s preferences consistently differ from their gender conforming peers (the deﬁnition of gender nonconformity), but only sometimes was this difference in the direction opposite their sex at birth. Furthermore, Zucker et al. (1999) found that a group of 3 to 10-year-old gender nonconforming children showed an atypical understanding of gender constancy. That is, the gender diverse group of children was less likely than gender-typical children to believe that their own gender was stable across time (gender stability) or across changes in appearance (gender consistency) compared to others’ gender.”</p></blockquote><p id="0b49" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">After reading through most of this, I began to wonder if my brain would melt out my ears, on to the carpet, and create a large stain.

That is the Human Right’s Campaign definition. This study is measuring stereotypes. The study goes on to outline an experiment — of ‘measuring participant’s gender’. How did they do this?

This self will be composed of both gender identity — who I know myself to be as male, female, or other, and gender expressions — how I choose to perform my gender, including clothing choices, activity preferences, friendship choices, and so forth.

Perhaps Ehrensaft is taking into account the many ‘transgender lesbians’ who transition in mid-life.By insisting sexuality has nothing to do with transgenderism except ‘crossing at certain points’, Ehrensaft may also be sensitive to the gay critics who call this modern science of ‘transgender children’ gay conversion therapy.</p><p id="0023" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Ehrensaft then presents a summation of the ‘gender affirmative’ model that LGBTQI+ organizations are promoting, she is promoting, and oligarchs are funding.</p><blockquote class="ie if ig"><p id="b52d" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">“Basic premises of the gender affirmative model</p><p id="6f6f" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">• Gender variations are not disorders.</p><p id="5fd9" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">• Gender presentations are diverse and varied across cultures, requiring cultural sensitivity.</p><p id="de6b" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">• Gender involves an interweaving, over time, of biology; development and socialization; and culture and context.</p><p id="7d0d" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">• Gender may be fluid; it is not always binary.</p><p id="c380" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">• If present, individual psychological/psychiatric problems are more often than not secondary to negative interpersonal and cultural reactions to a child.</p><p id="7ead" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">• Gender pathology lies more in the culture than in the child.</p><p id="914c" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">“[…]</p><p id="b026" class="gh gi co hf gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">The basic therapeutic tenet of the gender affirmative model is quite simple: When it comes to knowing a child’s gender, it is not for us to tell, but for the children to say. In contrast to the watchful waiting model, once information is gathered to assess a child’s gender status, action is taken to allow that child to exercise that gender. Therefore, if after careful consideration, it becomes clear that a young child is affirmed in their gender, demonstrating that the gender they know themselves is different than or opposite to the gender that would match the sex assigned to them at birth, the gender affirmative model supports a social transition to allow that child to fully live in that gender, whether that child is 3, 7, or 17 years old. Such decision-making is governed by stages, rather than ages, both for social transitions and later for medical interventions. Once the child’s gender comes into clear focus, which is posited as happening with a child of any age, no need is seen to hold off until adolescence to affirm that gender. This viewpoint is informed by data indicating the psychological harm that can be done, including heightened risk for generalized anxiety, social anxiety, oppositional behaviors, depression, compromised school performance, if a youth experiences themselves living in a gender that is inauthentic to them.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5448699/#b25-ahmt-8-057" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">25</a>”</p></blockquote><p id="52d5" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Remember, according to the <em class="hf">Human Rights Campaign</em> and Ehrensaft herself, gender is stereotypes.

Despite this pathology being cultural, and acknowledging this fact, Ehrensaft still wants to chemically and physically castrate children who do not conform to ‘gender’. If a child believes they should be, or are the other sex, because they do not conform to society’s expectations and stereotypes of their sex, Ehrensaft believes we should medicalize this and treat them with drugs, and ultimately ‘affirm their gender’ by<em class="hf"> castrating</em> them.

The challenge is when these youth ask for a particular medical intervention that achieves that goal of a middle ground — perhaps a touch of testosterone, or chest surgery with no other intervention and a chosen pronoun of “they” rather than “he” or “she”.

In the Dutch authors’ words, the treatment, including puberty suppression, cross-sex hormones, and then in adulthood gender affirmation surgery, “leads to improved psychological functioning of transgender adolescents. While enabling them to make important age-appropriate developmental transitions, it contributes to a satisfactory objective and subjective well-being in young adulthood”.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5448699/#b33-ahmt-8-057" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">33</a> The authors propose that not only early medical intervention, but also a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach contributes to the youth’s gender health.

The totality of my research was impossible to fit into a single article. But the evidence is clear: transgenderism isn’t a real civil rights movement.</p><p id="189c" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Let us think about it: what every group in the transgender lobby is demanding is essentially guaranteed access to medication for off-label purposes. None of these drugs are approved for transgender uses. Given the data we do have and the state of the science behind that data, accompanied by the side effects up to and including death, it is unlikely to ever be approved by the FDA in a clinical trial. Unless, of course, the side effects were better than the outcome. Hence, the creation of a perception that transgender people are murdered a at higher rates than the general population, even though that isn’t true. Saying that the side effects are better than the suicide of the patient probably wouldn’t pass muster either, given that medical intervention did not change the fact that transgender people have elevated suicide rates compared to the general population.</p><p id="87cd" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Hence our endless bad statistics and fake news. A survey with methodological flaws and some good messaging can cover for the actual reality, at least to the general public. Because the one way these ‘treatments’ could get approved is if the problem is worse than the side effects and the solution — this poor, gender dysphoric wilting flower of a person will kill themselves or be murdered unless they can access ‘gender-affirming healthcare’. Dangerous drugs that have failed clinical trials before could be issued on-label for this process, and protected by civil rights legislation. That the ideology that is built around these demands is incoherent, serves only to foist drugs on to vulnerable people, and is fundamentally homophobic is of little consequence to those who see the dollar signs. Transition could be a big business, which over a 50-year period of ‘transition’ could create a market worth trillions of dollars, if not more. Think of the potential markets! Surgeries that run into the six-figures. Body modifications that have not yet been invented outside of science fiction. And some of the 90’s best-selling-drugs, drugs that could be best-sellers again if only they had blanket approval to be used on a class of people once again.</p><p id="138e" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Almost every philanthropist I investigated had financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry — George Soros and his connections to Pfizer and chemical company Monsanto, Jon Stryker, who is an heir to the Stryker Corporation, which makes medical and surgical supplies.

Perhaps homophobia is their reason, or perhaps they truly believe. Maybe it really is about being ‘validated’ as a ‘woman’. If so, Pritzker is being taken for as much a ride as any other activist, they simply have more fiscal ability to promulgate the ideology. The ideology is a byproduct of the main goal — which is guaranteeing access to expensive, off-label drugs for a group of people, with civil protections. That the ideology has morphed into one that demands lesbians make themselves sexually available to male bodies, where ‘sexual fluidity’ is considered the ideal, and had its <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/safe-t-is-just-another-term-for-reparative-therapy_us_57eea18de4b07f20daa108cb" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">language appropriated and used by Christian conversion therapy groups</a> promising a ‘cure’ to homosexuality seems to matter little.</p><p id="caf1" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">To do this, they have hijacked the once powerful and grassroots gay lobby with large amounts of philanthropic and corporate funding, to the point these organizations have changed their names in order to be ‘inclusive’.

Ultimately, my concern is for the homosexuals who have lost control of their movement and now face a group of people that believes that their gender non-conformity requires surgery, even if they are children. And if transgenderism does not fall over because of these things, it will fall over because of the lawsuits those children will make.

The ability of the very rich to divert their funds into services and organizations they believe is optimal without any democratic consent is fundamentally anti-democratic, no matter how much you may agree with their aims. Had the billions poured into philanthropy gone to the state, many of these problems could have been solved.

Ultimately, their voice and vote does not matter. This creates a situation where ideologies such as transgenderism, an ideology that is fundamentally incoherent and experimenting on children can be accepted on the left. A situation where the punishment for not going along with the party line is a violently enforced exile.</p><p id="f924" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">The influence these large foundations and their funders have on our politics cannot be underestimated, and it needs to be questioned.

The question of what came first-the foundations, the pharmaceutical companies, or the medical professionals -is like asking whether the chicken or the egg came first. But the fact of the matter is, all three groups stand to benefit from the transgender civil rights movement. No transgender person does. With no unbiased research, they cannot get the answers they need to treat their condition effectively. They are left stranded and marooned, with an entire movement dedicated to foisting drugs upon them, instead of finding an actual cure or treatment for gender dysphoria. When ‘transition’ is complete and they are left a castrated eunuch, with no more steps up the Bridge To Total Freedom, their suicidality does not decrease. With an incomplete path to salvation, they are told they can chase after something they can never realize. They are obliterated as a distinct legal class of people by self-identification legislation — the legal ramifications of which could set trans rights back years, which <a href="http://mirandayardley.com/en/how-transgender-became-the-new-black-presentation-in-parliament-on-31-october-2017/" class="bq de hg hh hi hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has been raised by gender critical trans activists such as Miranda Yardley.</a></p><p id="0b29" class="gh gi co at gj b gk gl gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt gu" data-selectable-paragraph="">The modern transgender movement is an astroturf tiger.

An entire generation of gender non-conforming children that may have otherwise grown up gay are going to grow up to be brain damaged, weakened eunuchs with a medical malpractice lawyer on retainer.

Even though transgender people are supposedly a persecuted minority that need civil rights, Vote No on Prop 1 out spent and out raised Alaska Family Action by around $710,000. In total, Vote No had $828,000 at its disposal. Its campaign filings reveal that a large majority of this money came from a set of lobbying groups almost from central casting: The Human Rights Campaign (HRC), Freedom for All Americans (FFAA), Planned Parenthood (PP), and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Large, federally based organizations poured money and staff into a small municipal election, all to fight ‘bathroom bills’. They flew in representatives from the National Center of Transgender Equality to help with ‘story telling’, and The Transgender Law Center provided consulting services. They made sure volunteers were well fed — ACLU makes many filings throughout for providing catering at events for volunteers.

The Gender And Sex Development Program is run by one Robert Garofalo, who will be mentioned later on. Pritzker also provides funding to the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), and has also donated to GLAAD, among other large LGBTQI+ organizations.Apart from t their transgender donations, Pritzker is extremely right-wing. Alternating their occupation between ‘Retired’ and ‘Tawani Enterprises Inc’ on FEC returns, Pritzker donated hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars, to the Republican Party and its candidates in 2016, including state parties and the ‘National Draft Ben Carson For President Committee’. Perhaps Pritzker wishes GLAAD to debunk anyone saying the pyramids were not grain silos. To balance this all out, Pritzker gave small donations to Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat. SuperPACs Pritzker donated to include the American Future Fund, which has received funding from the Koch Brothers, and Bruce Rassetter (who runs the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.) Pritzker donated $33,900 to the Republican National Committee in April this year.

The legitimate reader may then propagate the message again, giving an air of legitimacy and authenticity to the message, and then what is a ‘meme’ in the Dawkins sense (though astroturfing can also be internet memes, as the world discovered when the House Intelligence committee released Russian astroturf election advertising a few months ago) becomes repeated over and over.

Although typically focused on clinical outcomes (e.g., Cohen-Kettenis, Owen, Kaijser, Bradley, & Zucker, 2003), these research teams have occasionally reported on basic gender development, much as we do in the current study with socially transitioned transgender children. For example, one study found that while siblings of gen-der nonconforming children preferred to play with toys manufactured for children of their sex, gender nonconforming children (Mage= 7.6 years) did not — they equally preferred toys manufactured for their own sex and the other sex (Zucker, Bradley, Doering, & Lozinski, 1985). In contrast, for games, gender nonconforming children actually expressed a preference for games manufactured for the other sex, but their siblings did not. Thus, it appears that gender nonconforming children’s preferences consistently differ from their gender conforming peers (the deﬁnition of gender nonconformity), but only sometimes was this difference in the direction opposite their sex at birth. Furthermore, Zucker et al. (1999) found that a group of 3 to 10-year-old gender nonconforming children showed an atypical understanding of gender constancy. That is, the gender diverse group of children was less likely than gender-typical children to believe that their own gender was stable across time (gender stability) or across changes in appearance (gender consistency) compared to others’ gender.”","hasDropCap":null,"dropCapImage":null,"markups":[],"__typename":"Paragraph","iframe":null,"mixtapeMetadata":null},"Paragraph:a1bcb9b44d8f_236":{"id":"a1bcb9b44d8f_236","name":"0b49","type":"P","href":null,"layout":null,"metadata":null,"text":"After reading through most of this, I began to wonder if my brain would melt out my ears, on to the carpet, and create a large stain.

Therefore, if after careful consideration, it becomes clear that a young child is affirmed in their gender, demonstrating that the gender they know themselves is different than or opposite to the gender that would match the sex assigned to them at birth, the gender affirmative model supports a social transition to allow that child to fully live in that gender, whether that child is 3, 7, or 17 years old. Such decision-making is governed by stages, rather than ages, both for social transitions and later for medical interventions. Once the child’s gender comes into clear focus, which is posited as happening with a child of any age, no need is seen to hold off until adolescence to affirm that gender.
